AB  - Background: Rice Bran Arabinoxylan Compound (RBAC) is a nutritional supplement produced by enzymatic hydrolysis of hemicellulose B derived from rice bran. Several in vitro studies and clinical reports have shown RBAC to possess promising immunomodulating effects, specifically with respect to natural killer cell and cytokine activity. The concept of a true immunomodulator is an agent possessing a broad range of activity dependent upon the existing state of health and immunity in the individual host. The present study investigated the immunomodulatory effect of RBAC in a healthy adult human population over 60 days by assessing changes in natural killer cell cytotoxicity (NKCC) and cytokines and growth factors. Subjects participated in a two-group, randomized intervention, where one group (n=10) consumed 1 gram/day and the other (n=10) consumed 3 gram/day. Safety and tolerability of RBAC were assessed with total bilirubin, total protein, creatinine, and liver function tests.
Results: We found that both groups had similar responses for NKCC, cytokines, and growth factors. The NKCC peaked at 1 week, whereas interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukins-1α, -1β, -8, and -10, and epidermal growth factor peaked at 30 days. All subjects tolerated the supplement without any adverse reactions.
Conclusions: Our results showed transient, bi-directional, immune marker effects consistent with true, multifactorial immunomodulation rather than simply immunostimulation or immunosuppression. Given our findings, the immunomodulatory activity of RBAC merits study in conditions where the immune system is functionally compromised (e.g., otherwise-healthy smokers and HIV/AIDS or cancer patients). RBAC may not only help to destroy tumor cells and viruses directly, but also increase the activity of immune cells, thereby optimizing the immune system, especially NKCC, which can increase the chance and speed of host recovery.

AB  - Background : Rice bran is a byproduct of the milling process of rice. Rice bran contains several polysaccharides which consist of hemicellulose, beta-glucan, arabinoxylan, pectin and others. The hemicelullose indgredient of rice bran, which studies have shown is special for its high antitumor effect, has given rice bran attention as a new biological response modifier (BRM) material. While rice bran consists mainly of plant cell wall constituents, its less digestibility and absorption rate in human body consumption is a problem. Therefore, studies to enhance biological activity by improving these problems have been performed. Fermented rice bran extract, exo-biopolymer from submerged culture of Lentinus edodes with rice bran (EBLE) uses biological conversion (bioconversion) techniques to assist the degradation of rice bran fiber induced by carbohydrolase from Lentinus edodes. In previous studies, the polysaccharide components from exo-biopolymer extract promote proliferation of mouse macrophages and spleen cells, and improve immune function showing potential as a material represented as BRM, but research is still limited. Thus, the purpose of the present study is to evaluate the immune-enhancing and immune-modulation effects of exo-biopolymer submerged culture of L. edodes with rice bran in vitro and in vivo, and is to investigate the possibility as a new BRM material . the polysaccharide components from exo-biopolymer extract promote proliferation of mouse macrophages and spleen cells, and improve immune function showing potential as a material represented as BRM, but research is still limited.

Material and method: In vitro cell cytotoxicity of EBLE was measured by MTS assay on L929 mouse fibroblast cells. The evaluation of antioxidative activity of EBLE was performed by measuring oxygen radical absorbance capacity and total antioxidant status. In vivo atopic dermatitis of NC/Nga mice were induced with DNCB as applied to shaved dorsal fur (group n=7). EBLE administered for 4 weeks at a 250 mg/kg dose by using oral zonde. Skin lesions of atopic dermatitis were evaluated using a modified SCORAD index. The mouse ascites cancer model was induced with an intraperitoneal injection of sarcoma 180 murine fibrosarcoma cell line to ICR mice at a concentration of 1×106 cells/mouse (group n=10). EBLE applied to mice by oral administration or intraperitoneal injection for 2 weeks at a 250 mg/kg dose. The survival rate and prolongation rate were evaluated at the time of 50% of the population of mice. The cancer cell growth rate was calculated by increase of body weight. Hematopoietic profiles measured from angular vein blood of mice.

Results : Cell cytotoxicity of EBLE on L929 mouse fibroblast did not appear at 500 μg/ml. The total oxygen radical absorbance capacity and total antioxidant status were measured 772 μmole TE/g and 0.4 mmol/100 g. In DNCB induced atopic dermatitis model of NC/Nga mice, SCORAD index less scored in EBLE administered group. Atopy related peripheral and splenocytes cytokines, IgE, IL-4 and IL-10 were significantly decreased in EBLE administered group. IFN-γ and IFN-γ/IL-4 ratio was significantly increased in EBLE administered group. In sarcoma180 bearing ascites cancer mice model, the cancer cell growth rate was significantly decreased in EBLE treated group, however the survival rate and prolongation rate were significantly increased.

Conclusion: Results of the study, EBLE has a high antioxidant capacity, antiallergic activity, and anticancer activity. However more research is required about the mechanisms of immune-modulation activity and clinical studies.

AB  - In the current study, we investigated the chemopreventive activity of arabinoxylan rice bran, MGN-3/Biobran, against chemical induction of glandular stomach carcinogenesis in rats. Gastric cancer was induced by carcinogen methylnitronitrosoguanidine (MNNG), and rats received MNNG alone or MNNG plus Biobran (40 mg/kg body weight) for a total of 8 months. Averaged results from 2 separate readings showed that exposure to MNNG plus Biobran caused gastric dysplasia and cancer (adenocarcinoma) in 4.5/12 rats (9/24 readings, 37.5%), with 3.5/12 rats (7/24 readings, 29.2%) showing dysplasia and 1/12 rats (8.3%) developing adenocarcinoma. In contrast, in rats treated with MNNG alone, 8/10 (80%) developed dysplasia and adenocarcinoma, with 6/10 rats (60%) showing dysplasia and 2/10 rats (20%) developing adenocarcinoma. The effect of combining both agents was also associated with significant suppression of the expression of the tumor marker Ki-67 and remarkable induction in the apoptotic gastric cancer cells via mitochondrial-dependent pathway as indicated by the upregulation in p53 expression, Bax expression, downregulation in Bcl-2 expression, an increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and an activation of caspase-3. In addition, Biobran treatment induced cell-cycle arrest in the subG1 phase, where the hypodiploid cell population was markedly increased. Moreover, Biobran treatment protected rats against MNNG-induced significant decrease in lymphocyte levels. We conclude that Biobran provides protection against chemical induction of glandular stomach carcinogenesis in rats and may be useful for the treatment of human patients with gastric cancer.

AB  - ABSTRACT: In this study, we examine the ability of arabinoxylan rice bran (MGN-3/Biobran) to enhance the apoptotic effect of paclitaxel (Taxol) at low concentration [2 mg/kg body weight (BW)] in animals bearing Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cells and elucidate its mechanisms of action. On Day 8 following tumor cells inoculation, mice bearing tumors were administered MGN-3 alone (40 mg/kg BW), paclitaxel alone, or MGN-3 plus paclitaxel. On Day 30 post-tumor inoculation, we observed significant suppression of tumor volume (TV) with paclitaxel alone (59%), MGN-3 alone (77%), and MGN-3 plus paclitaxel (88%). Inhibition of tumor growth post-treatment with both agents, as compared with either treatment alone, was associated with a decrease in cell proliferation, a marked increase in the sub-G0/G1 population, an increase in DNA damage and apoptosis of tumor cells, and a significant maximization of the apoptosis index (AI)/proliferation index (PrI) ratio. Histopathological and electron microscopy examination of the combined treatment group showed an increase in the degenerative regions of the solid tumor tissue and abundant apoptotic cells. These data suggest that MGN-3 supplementation enhances tumor cell demise in the presence of a low dose of chemotherapeutic agent via apoptotic mechanism.

AB  - To investigate  the  protective effects of  biobran against N-nitrosodiethyamine (NDEA) and carbon tetrachloride CCl4-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in rats. Hepatocarcinogenesis was induced in rats by a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of N-nitrosodiethyamine (NDEA) at a dose of 200 mg/kg body weight followed by weekly subcutaneous injections of CCl4 (3 ml/kg) for 6 weeks, as the promoter of carcinogenic effect. After administration of the carcinogen, 25 mg/kg/day of Biobran were administered i.p., five times a week throughout the study. At the end of  20 weeks, the body weight, liver weight were measured, blood samples  were collected for liver function tests, liver biopsies were processed for histopathology examination. Results demonstrated that biobran has significantly prevented the decrease of the body weight and the increase in the liver weight caused by NDEA.  Liver function tests showed significant increase in serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and γ -glutamyl transpeptidase (γ -GT) of untreated NDEA group, meanwhile treatment  with Biobran to rats exposed to carcinogens, significantly minimized the  elevation of  the  liver  function  enzymes level  to be comparable with the normal control values. Histopathological examination of the liver sections  of rats subjected to (DENA + CCl4) treatment revealed fibrosis and fatty infiltration of hepatocytes, with inflammatory collection and loss of architecture Biobran treatment showed minimal changes in hepatocyte morphology and histology with no inflammation. this study showed that  Biobran has a protective effect against hepatocarcinogenesis induced by NDEA and CCl4 in rats.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers in the world and one of the most lethal. MGN-3/Biobran is a natural product derived from rice bran hemicelluloses and has been reported to possess a potent anticancer effect in a clinical study of patients with HCC. The current study examines the mechanisms by which Biobran protects against chemically induced hepatocarcinogenesis in rats. The chemical carcinogen used in this study is N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) plus carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)). Rats were treated with this carcinogen, and the animals were pretreated or posttreated with Biobran via intraperitoneal injections until the end of the experiment. Treatment with Biobran resulted in: 1) significant alleviation of liver preneoplastic lesions towards normal hepatocellular architecture in association with inhibition of collagen fiber deposition; 2) arrest of cancer cells in the sub-G1 phase of the cell cycle; 3) increased DNA fragmentation in cancer cells; 4) down-regulated expression of Bcl-2 and up-regulated expression of p53, Bax, and caspase-3; and 5) protection against carcinogen-induced suppression of IkappaB-alpha (IκB-α) mRNA expression and inhibition of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB/p65) expression. Additionally, the effect of Biobran treatment was found to be more significant when supplemented prior to carcinogen-induced hepatocarcinogenesis as compared to posttreatment. We conclude that Biobran inhibits hepatocarcinogenesis in rats by mechanisms that include induction of apoptosis, inhibition of inflammation, and suppression of cancer cell proliferation. Biobran may be a promising chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agent for liver carcinogenesis.

AB  - This study examines the ability of arabinoxylan rice bran (MGN-3/Biobran) to enhance the anti-cancer effects of fractionated X-ray irradiation of Ehrlich solid tumor-bearing mice. Swiss albino mice bearing tumors were exposed to the following: (i) Biobran treatment (40 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneal injections) beginning on day 11 post-tumor cell inoculation until day 30; (ii) ionizing radiation (Rad) 2 Gy at three consecutive doses on days 12, 14 and 16; or (iii) Biobran + Rad. Final tumor weight was suppressed by 46% for Biobran, 31% for Rad and 57% for the combined treatment (Biobran + Rad) relative to control untreated mice. Biobran and Rad also arrested the hypodiploid cells in the sub-G1-phase, signifying apoptosis by +102% and +85%, respectively, while the combined treatment induced apoptosis by +123%, with similar results in the degree of DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, Biobran + Rad upregulated the relative gene expression and protein level of p53 and Bax in tumor cells, down-regulated Bcl-2 expression, and increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-3 activity, with the combined treatment greater than for either treatment alone. Additionally, the combined treatment modulated the decrease in body weight, the increase in liver and spleen weight, and the elevation of liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase to be within normal values. We conclude that Biobran enhances radiation therapy-induced tumor regression by potentiating apoptosis and minimizing toxicities related to radiation therapy, suggesting that Biobran may be useful in human cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy and warranting clinical trials.

AB  - This study was undertaken to investigate the in vivo anti-tumor activity of MGN-3/Biobran, a modified arabinoxylan rice bran. Swiss albino mice were inoculated intramuscularly in the right thigh with Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cells. On Day 8, mice bearing a solid Ehrlich carcinoma (SEC) tumor were treated with MGN-3 via intraperitoneal injection. Tumor growth, cytokine production, and apoptotic effect of MGN-3 were examined. MGN-3 caused a highly significant delay in both tumor volume (63.27%) and tumor weight (45.2%) as compared to controls (P < 0.01). The mechanisms by which MGN-3 exerts its antitumor effect seem to involve its ability to induce apoptosis and immune modulation. MGN-3 induced a 1.8-fold increase in the percentage of apoptotic SEC cells as determined by flow cytometry and the histopathological examination. In addition, MGN-3 influenced plasma cytokine production by increasing the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma, while downregulating levels of the immune suppressing cytokine interleukin-10. Data also showed that non-tumor-bearing mice intramuscularly injected with MGN-3 resulted in a twofold increase in natural killer activity. No adverse side effects due to MGN-3 treatment were observed; all animals displayed normal feeding/drinking and life activity patterns. These data may have clinical implications for the treatment of solid cancers.

AB  - The objective of the current study was to determine the effects of arabinoxylane and
polysaccharide peptide (PSP) on the immune cell functions. Both arabinoxylane and PSP increased plaque forming cell (10〜 15%) and rosette forming cell (10〜30%) formation. Stimulation of macrophage with PSP (18%) and arabinoxylane (22%) resulted in increased phagocytic effects. Both arabinoxylane and PSP induced the tumor supressive effect in mice injected sarcoma-180 cell intracutaneously. When the mice injected intraperitoneal cavity with sarcoma 180 cells, survival ratio was increased in the mice fed on arabinoxylane and PSP. The ratio of PCA was slightly decreased in the mice fed on PSP, especially fed on arabinoxylane than in the control mice. The concentrations of blood histamine were slightly decreased in the mice fed on arabinoxylane and PSP. These results suggest that the capacity of arabinoxylane and PSP seems to act as a potent immunomodulator causing augmentation of immune cell activity, and with the absence of notable side-effects, arabinoxylane and PSP could be used as a biological response modifier having possible therapeutic effects against immunological disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMSThis study examined the efficacy of arabinoxylan rice bran (MGN-3) in conjunction with an interventional therapy (IT) for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma patients.PATIENTS AND METHODSA total of sixty-eight patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (stages I and II) participated in the study. Patients were randomized to receive IT (30 patients, control group) or IT+MGN-3 (38 patients), and randomly divided into two groups using a computer-generated randomization list. Patients and investigators were blinded. IT included transarterial oily chemoembolization (TOCE) or a combination of TOCE and percutaneous ethanol injection treatment (PEIT).RESULTSPatients in the IT+MGN-3 group showed: (i) lower recurrence of the disease, 31.6% (12/38), as compared to 46.7% (14/30) for the control; (ii) higher survival after the second year, 35%, as compared to 6.7% for the control; (iii) significantly lower alpha-fetoprotein level, a 38% decrease (p = 0.0001), as compared to baseline value, while the control showed no significant change; and (iv) a significant decrease in tumor volume, in contrast to the control, which showed no significant change. When the results were analyzed according to each IT modality, MGN-3+IT sub-groups displayed a greater response to treatment, in every aspect examined, than the IT sub-groups alone. However, the patients in the MGN-3+TOCE+PEIT sub-group demonstrated greater reduction in AFP levels and longer survival time than the MGN-3+TOCE sub-group.CONCLUSIONMGN-3 in conjunction with IT may be useful for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and warrants further investigation in multiple clinical trials.

AB  - Introduction and objective: Prostate cancer (CaP) remains a major concern of public health in the United States. Standard treatment already in clinical use has a high curability rate in patients diagnosed with localized and androgen-dependent CaP; however, the progression to hormone refractory CaP is associated with disease relapse and poor prognosis. Hence, it is important to discover a novel strategy to prevent progression of disease whilst minimizing toxicity. One such promising approach is the dietary administration of certain natural compounds such as RBAC, a rice bran carbohydrate extract hydrolyzed by Shiitake mushroom enzymes. Several experimental studies have shown that RBAC in vitro increases both susceptibility and sensitivity of many human malignant cells to undergo apoptosis and to respond to chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, RBAC immunomodulates natural killer (NK) cells in vitro and in vivo and enhances plasma cytokine production and anti-tumor activity in an in vivo mouse model. The aim of this study was to investigate the direct anti-tumor activity of RBAC on CaP cell lines and its impact on cell proliferation, adhesion, and invasion.
Methods: A panel of stromal and epithelial cell lines was used [Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC) and CaP epithelial cell lines (PC3 and LNCaP)]. Cell lines were cultured in appropriate media supplemented with 10% FBS in a 5% CO2
proliferation assays, Cytotracker™ adhesion assay, and CytoSelect™ invasion assay, respectively.
Results: RBAC significantly decreased the epithelial cell proliferation of MSC, and CaP human malignant cell lines (PC3 and LNCaP) (p<0.05). The inhibition occurred in a dose-dependent manner and was more pronounced at high doses of RBAC (1000 µg/ml). Also, that same dose of RBAC impaired the MSC-PC3 cell adhesion and PC3 cell invasion in vitro.
Conclusions: These data suggest that RBAC exhibits an anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on CaP cell lines in vitro and might have therapeutic potential in advanced human CaP

AB  - Objectives/aims: Arabinoxylan rice bran (MGN‐3/ Biobran, Daiwa Pharmaceutical) has shown immunomodulatory effects, including augmentation of NK cell activity, inhibition of HIV replication in vitro in mononuclear cells, enhancement cytotoxic CD8 T‐cell activity in HIV‐infected patients, reduced exercise‐ and lipopolysaccharide‐induced inflammation in an animal model, and reduced high sensitivity C‐reactive protein (hsCRP) in irritable bowel syndrome. We evaluated the anti‐inflammatory effects of arabinoxylan rice bran supplementation in virologically suppressed participants with HIV who had incomplete immune reconstitution. Markers of inflammation, microbial translocation and monocyte/macrophage activation were measured including soluble CD14 (sCD14), soluble CD163 (sCD163), lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukin‐6 (IL‐6). Our primary hypothesis was that arabinoxylan rice bran supplementation would reduce sCD14 levels. Methods: We conducted a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial of 27 adults with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART) with CD4+ cell counts of 100‐350 cells/mm3, who had been on ART with HIV‐1 RNA ≤50 copies/ml for at least 24 weeks prior to entry. Participants were randomized to receive two 500 mg capsules of arabinoxylan rice bran three times daily (n=13) or two placebo capsules three times daily (n=14) for 12 weeks. Fasting blood samples were obtained in the morning at entry and week 12. Soluble CD14, sCD163, LBP and IL‐6 were measured by ELISA (R&D Systems). A total sample of 24 participants (12 per arm) would detect a clinically relevant difference of 0.07 log10 in sCD14 (and other biomarkers) between treatment versus placebo arms with 90% power and a 0.05 twosided type I error rate, assuming the sd of the changes in log10 sCD14 from baseline to week 12 is 0.05 for both groups. Absolute change in sCD14 (and other biomarkers) from baseline to week 12 was compared between the treatment arm and the placebo arm by a two‐sided, two‐sample t‐test. The primary efficacy analysis was a modified intent‐to‐treat analysis, which included all randomized participants for whom baseline and week 12 samples were available for assays. Results: A total of 24 participants were included in our analyses (12 rice bran and 12 placebo). Three participants were lost to follow‐up. Those included had chronic HIV infection, with a median ART duration of 144 months (range 24‐444). The median baseline CD4 cell count was 244 cells/mm3 (range 117‐354). There was no statistically significant difference in the change in sCD14, sCD163, IL‐6, hsCRP or LBP levels from baseline to 12 weeks between the treatment and placebo group (Table 1). Treatment was well tolerated with no withdrawals due to side effects. Discussion: We found no evidence of a beneficial effect of 12 weeks of arabinoxylan rice bran supplementation on markers of inflammation and monocyte/macrophage activation in virologically suppressed participants with HIV who had inadequate immune reconstitution.

AB  - The objective of the current study was to determine the effects of arabinoxylane and  polysaccharide peptide (PSP) on mouse splenocytes, T cells, B cells and macrophages in vitro. Arabinoxylane and PSP directly induced the proliferation of spleen cells in a dose-dependent manner and increased IFN-γ synthesis. Especially, PSP induced IL-2, IL-4 and IL-10 production, Both arabinoxylane and PSP increased PFC (plaque forming cell) and RFC (rosette forming cell) formation. Arabinoxylane was not induced the proliferation of T cells, but PSP directly induced the proliferation of T cells in a high dose. Arabinoxylane and PSP increased the proliferation of B cells and the phagocytic effects of macrophage.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that dietary supplementation with rice bran fermented with Lentinus edodes (rice bran exo-biopolymer, RBEP), a substance known to contain arabinoxylan, enhances natural killer (NK) cell activity and modulates cytokine production in healthy adults. METHODS: This study was designed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and parallel-group format. Eighty healthy participants with white blood cell counts of 4,000-8,000 cells/μL were randomly assigned to take six capsules per day of either 3 g RBEP or 3 g placebo for 8 weeks. Three participants in the placebo group were excluded after initiation of the protocol; no severe adverse effects from RBEP supplementation were reported. NK cell activity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was measured using nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay kits and serum cytokine concentrations included interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-12 were measured by Bio-Plex cytokine assay kit. This study was registered with the Clinical Research Information Service (KCT0000536). RESULTS: Supplementation of RBEP significantly increased IFN-γ production compared with the placebo group (P = 0.012). However, RBEP supplementation did not affect either NK cell activity or cytokine levels, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-α, compared with the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained in this study indicate that RBEP supplementation increases IFN-γ secretion without causing significant adverse effects, and thus may be beneficial to healthy individuals. This new rice bran-derived product may therefore be potentially useful to include in the formulation of solid and liquid foods designed for treatment and prevention of pathological states associated with defective immune responses.

AB  - Abstract: Dendritic cells (DCs) and natural killer (NK) cells are central components of innate immunity for controlling tumor growth. The therapeutic effects of certain anti-myeloma drugs are partially mediated by targeting the innate immune response. In addition, novel types of natural compounds have been developed that efficiently modulate the activity of both the cellular and humoral compartments of immunity. MGN-3 is known as an activator of natural killer cells, inducer of apoptosis and cytokine production, and modulator of dendritic cell maturation and differentiation in vitro. We have performed a randomized, placebo-controlled study to examine the effects of MGN-3 on innate immune system parameters in 48 multiple myeloma patients. We performed immunophenotypic analysis of peripheral blood samples, determined NK cell activity, and assessed the cytokine profiles of plasma before and during 3 months of treatment. The results demonstrate a clear increase in NK activity in MGN-3-treated patients compared to the placebo group, an increased level of myeloid DCs in peripheral blood, and augmented concentrations of T helper cell type 1-related cytokines. The present study suggests that MGN-3 may represent an immunologically relevant product for activating innate immunity in multiple myeloma patients and warrants further testing to demonstrate clinical efficacy.

AB  - BioBran, enzymatically modified arabinoxylan from rice bran was tested for its possible effects on in vitro maturation of human dendritic cells (DC). Immature DC (iDC) derived from plastic-adhered, IL-4 and GM-CSF treated peripheral monocytes (Mo) were further cultured with cytokine maturation mix 1 (CMM1; TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6) or CMM2 (LPS and IFN-gamma) to induce their maturation into mature DC (matDC1 or matDC2, respectively). Different concentrations of BioBran (10, 100, 400 and 1000 microg/ml) were applied in the presence or absence of relevant CMM to assess the effects of BioBran on DC maturation processes. BioBran induced maturation of iDC, as these cells cultured with IL-4/GM-CSF/BioBran down-regulated CD14 and CD1a antigens on cell surface and significantly increased expression of maturation marker CD83. The increase of surface density of costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 on iDC in the presence of BioBran was also observed. In addition, BioBran induced functional maturation of iDC, confirmed by decreased endocytic activity of iDC. Further emore, BioBran enhanced maturation potential of cytokine mixes, as both matDC1 and matDC2 exposed to BioBran completely lost CD14 and upregulated CD83, CD80 and CD86 antigens, in comparison to DC matured with the relevant CMM alone. BioBran also increased CD123 antigen expression on all DC subsets. Interestingly, matDC2 matured in the presence of BioBran (400microg/ml) expressed higher levels of CD123 and lower levels of CD11c cell surface antigens, the phenotype represented by CD11c<sup>dim</sup> CD123<sup>bright</sup> plasmacytoid DC population. These data demonstrate that BioBran is a potent enhancer of DC maturation and suggest that BioBran might be a useful agent to create the environment that favours DC maturation.

AB  - The hepatoprotective effects of fermented black rice bran extracts (FF1 and FF2: black rice bran fermented by Lentinus edodes derived from mycelium supplemented with soybean or Hovenia dulcis) and their associated mechanisms were evaluated. In an in vitro experiment, FFs caused significant amelioration of the metabolic function of rat hepatocytes treated with NH4Cl. In addition, administration of FFs to rats with chronic liver injury induced by 12-week continual alcohol consumption resulted in significant restoration of body weight shrinkage, notable attenuation of excessive aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and endotoxin in serum, malondialdehyde in liver and the lactulose/mannitol ratio in urine. Furthermore, FF1 or FF2 also caused significant downregulation of gene expression of several critical inflammatory mediators (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase). Histopathological findings also indicated that FFs reduced inflammation, necrosis and fatty infiltration in liver tissue. Taken together, FFs exert hepatoprotective effects through anti-inflammatory and anti-lipid peroxidative properties and regulation of intestinal permeability.Practical ApplicationsIn this study, mycelia fermentation was utilized as a feasible strategy for enhancing the hepatotherapeutic effect of black rice and herbs. The findings demonstrated that Hovenia dulcis exerts a synergistic protective effect on an alcoholic liver disease animal model and could provide a new effective potential approach to alleviate alcoholic liver diseases.

AB  - This study is to verify whether there is a significant difference compared to the control group in enhancing immunity when fermented rice bran powder is administered to healthy adults.
As it was reported that rice bran fermented powder can exert various effects from various infectious diseases to cancer prevention by increasing immunity in laboratory and animal studies, as a result of publication in two academic journals and internal research, we intend to verify its effectiveness through this study. .

The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of immunity enhancement before and 8 weeks after taking fermented rice bran powder. The study subjects were healthy adults with a white blood cell count greater than or equal to 4X1000 and less than 8X1000 cells/ul, and were designed for 8 weeks, placebo-controlled, double-blind, and randomized.

Efficacy endpoints were NK cell activity, WBC count, IFN-γ, IL-2, 4, 10, 12, and TNF-α.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide with an estimated 626,000 new cases per year worldwide, accounting for 5.7% of new cancer cases. Although resection and transplantation offer the best 5‐year survival rates, not all patients are suitable surgery candidates. Other treatments include pericutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), and transarterial oily chemoembolization (TOCE), all of which enhance the survival rate and aid in shrinkage of the tumor. The very low survival rate among HCC patients, 3‐5%, reflects the inadequacy of conventional therapies for the disease and highlights the necessity of finding new treatments or modifying the current treatment. The hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes liver disease that can range in severity from a mild illness that lasts several weeks (acute hepatitis B) to a long‐term chronic illness. An estimated 2 billion people have been infected with HBV worldwide, resulting in more than 350 million individuals with chronic, long‐term liver infections. Patients with chronic HBV infection are at a great risk for the development of cirrhosis, hepatic failure, and HCC. There is no cure for hepatitis B and care is mostly palliative. There are several anti‐viral and interferon drugs, such as Entecavir and Interferon α therapy, which can help some patients. However, these drugs are costly, thousands of dollars per year, and are not widely available in many countries, especially in the developing world. Vaccination is available and effective and is recommended for all individuals at risk for HBV infection. However, vaccination is only effective in individuals who have not been exposed to HBV. Hepatitis B is closely linked to liver cancer, which is almost always fatal. MGN‐3/Biobran is an arabinoxylan extracted from rice bran that is treated enzymatically with an extract from Shiitake mushrooms. MGN‐3 demonstrated anti‐cancer activity in vivo in mice and humans. The present study was carried out to examine whether combining the current conventional treatment with a food supplement, arabinoxylan rice bran (MGN‐3/Biobran), may improve the outcome of the disease and increase the survival rate of patients with HCC or HBV. We hypothesize that a combinatory treatment of conventional therapy with MGN‐3/Biobran will augment the therapeutic effect seen when patients are treated with conventional therapy alone.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the outcomes of a 60‐day trial of Rice Bran Arabinoxylan Compound (RBAC) among adults. Specifically, subjects will participate in a two‐group, randomized intervention that is based on a nutritional supplement made from a water soluble extract of rice bran that has been partially hydrolyzed by the action of a natural enzyme complex extracted from Shitake mushroom. One group will take 1 gram/day and the other group will take 3 gram/day to compare differences in outcomes between the two groups. We hypothesize that the 3 gram/day condition will demonstrate faster increases in outcomes compared to the 1 gram/day condition. The primary outcomes for this study will be Natural Killer (NK) cell activity, cytokines, total bilirubin, creatinine, and liver function tests. These outcomes will be compared between those subjects enrolled in the two treatment groups before and after 60 days. No substantial psychological, medical, or social risks exist to the participants, other than minor discomfort associated with the venipuncture. Although all measures to protect confidentiality will be put in place, the possibility exists that electronic data could be jeopardized. In the remote case that such event occurs, it will be immediately reported to the IRB. The components of RBAC should be harmless without significant food allergies. No serious, untoward side effects have been reported to the company by consumers nor observed during previous human studies. If any side effect does occur, the remedy is to discontinue until asymptomatic, and then reintroduce at 1/4 dosage, increasing by the same amount every 2 days, if uneventful, until full dosage is achieved. Dr. Ali will provide additional follow‐up and consultation with any subject who experiences an untoward side effect. A toxicology search for each component reveals no unique toxicity characteristic of the materials. As reported by Daiwa Health Development, the manufacturer of the product, thousands of people currently use RBAC (under the trade names BRM4 and PeakImmune 4), and Daiwa is unaware of significant toxicities. Daiwa applies the latest scientific methods to ensure the value and safety of their raw materials. Daiwa products are manufactured in state‐of‐the‐art facilities, under strict quality control and environmental protection standards. Participants will incur no additional appreciable psychological or social risks by participating in this study, although they may undergo psychological and physical discomfort sometimes. The process of interviewing during the assessment may cause discomfort. Discomfort or fatigue may also be experienced in completing the assessment battery. Alternatives to this study for enhancing immune system functioning include prescription medications, exercise, dietary modification, and other nutritional supplements. The risks of medications can be very significant, including life‐threatening, but the risk of taking nutritional supplements is not totally understood, since they are not regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration. Medications and nutritional supplements, as part of a change in lifestyle behaviors, may also prove to be beneficial for immune system functioning, but their long‐term use has unknown consequences. The information obtained in this study will help in determining the efficacy of using a rice bran extract nutritional supplement for enhancing immune system outcomes. By participating in the study, subjects may experience improved NK cell activity and cytokine functioning. The risk of participating in this study is reasonable because of the potential enhancements in immune system functioning with improved nutritional status.

AB  - Rationale: HIV infected persons have greater levels of inflammation and immune activation compared to the general population and are at greater risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) and other inflammation‐associated co‐morbidities. Intervention with BRM4 (Arabinoxylan Rice Bran Supplementation) in this population with impaired immune reconstitution may improve inflammation by a variety of mechanisms. Intervention: Arabinoxylan Rice Bran Supplementation with BRM4, is a nutritional supplement marketed in the US. It is composed of dietary fiber obtained from a denatured hemicellulose that is obtained by reacting rice bran hemicellulose with multiple carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzymes from Shiitake mushrooms. Objectives: The primary objective is to evaluate if 12 weeks of supplementation with arabinoxylan rice bran can safely reduce markers of inflammation during ART‐suppressed HIV infection and thus potentially reduce the potential to develop end‐organ disease in this group of at‐risk patients. Study population: HIV‐infected participants (≥18 years of age) who have been on stable ART for at least 24 weeks prior to study entry, and have impaired immune reconstitution defined as a CD4+ T‐cell count 100‐350 cells/mm3 prior to study entry, with plasma HIV‐1 RNA <50 copies/mL. In order to assure 24 evaluable subjects, the investigators will enroll 28 subjects total (assuming 15% lost to follow‐up rate). Study methodology: Randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial Description of study arms: At entry participants will be randomized to one of the following arms: Arm 1: BRM4 two 500mg capsules thrice daily p.o. for 12 weeks Arm 2: Placebo for Biobran two capsules thrice daily p.o. for 12 weeks Study endpoints: Primary ‐ changes in sCD14 levels after 12 weeks of intervention. Secondary ‐ week 12 changes in other inflammatory markers, microbial translocation, T‐cell counts, and metabolic variables. Follow‐up: Participants will not be followed after study completion, unless follow‐up is necessary for an adverse event. Statistics: A total sample of 24 evaluable subjects (12 per arm) is needed to detect a clinically relevant difference of 0.07 log10 in sCD14 levels between treatment vs. placebo arms with 90% power and a 0.05 two‐sided type I error rate. Plans for analysis: For the primary analysis, changes in sCD14 (and other biomarkers) from baseline to week 12 will be compared between the treatment arm and the placebo arm by a two‐sided, two‐sample t‐test.

AB  - The current study is a preliminary investigation of whether Biobran has the ability to restrict viremia in patients with chronic HCV or not. In addition, we examined the effect of Biobran on liver enzymes and inflammation as well as assessing any side effects of Biobran. Results show that treatment with Biobran resulted in a significant reduction in the viral load, an increase in liver enzymes, and patients reported good health. For the randomized trial, we selected 37 patients who had been admitted to El‐Kasr El‐Aini Hospital at Cairo, Egypt. The patients had been diagnosed with genotype 4 HCV infection. The study was approved by Cairo University Hospital, Cairo, Egypt and by IRB at Charles Drew school of medicine and Science, Los Angeles, CA, USA. The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki as reflected in the prior approval by Cairo University, El‐Kasr El‐Aini Hospital, Cairo, Egypt and by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Cairo University, Egypt and Charles R Drew University (CDU), Los Angeles, CA., USA. Thirty‐seven patients of both sexes (23 males and 14 females) with HCV (genotype 4), between the ages of 15 and 69, participated in the current study. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. The patients were divided randomly into two groups: the Biobran group and the PEG interferon plus ribavirin (control) group . Prior to treatment, clinical characteristics were determined for the patients in each group. The clinical characteristics of the HCV patients were investigated for hepatitis C, alpha‐fetoprotein (AFP) levels, total leucocyte count (TLC), Platelet (PLT) count, Hemoglobin (Hb) levels, triglyceride (TG) levels, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, blood clotting using International Normalized Ratio (INR), creatinine per milliliter (Cr/ml), and random blood sugar (RBG). Patients in the control group were treated with 180µg of pegylated IFN (Pegasys‐Roche) subcutaneously weekly for three months. In addition, they were given ribavirin according to their body weight (1200 mg for those over 75 kg and 1000 mg for those under 75 kg). The Biobran group was treated with Biobran, at a dose of 1g per day, allocated in packets, taken orally with meals for the three months duration of the study. Biobran is a denatured hemicellulose that is obtained by reacting rice bran hemicellulose with multiple carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzymes from Shiitake mushrooms. It is a polysaccharide that contains ß‐1, 3‐glucans, and activated hemicellulose. Biobran was kindly provided by Daiwa Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan. The patients were divided randomly into two groups: the Biobran group and the PEG interferon plus ribavirin (control) group . Prior to treatment, clinical characteristics were determined for the patients in each group. The clinical characteristics of the HCV patients were investigated for hepatitis C, alpha‐fetoprotein (AFP) levels, total leucocyte count (TLC), Platelet (PLT) count, Hemoglobin (Hb) levels, triglyceride (TG) levels, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, blood clotting using International Normalized Ratio (INR), creatinine per milliliter (Cr/ml), and random blood sugar (RBG). Viral load levels, toxicity, liver enzymes, and γ‐interferon (IFN‐γ) levels were examined before and three months after treatment. Viral load was examined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test using COBAS® TaqMan® Analyzer (Roche Corporation). IFN‐γ, AFP, ALT, and AST levels were analyzed using specific Elisa Kits, which were performed by Spectrum Chemical Manufacturing Corporation, Gardena, CA, USA, and toxicity was assessed by a questionnaire, physician observation, and laboratory results.

AB  - The current study investigated the effect of oral supplementation with Biobran/MGN‐3, 500 mg every day for 3 months, on several components of innate immune system and the incidence rate of influenza‐like illnesses (ILI) in older adults population. The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and was approval by Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Egypt. Zagazig University Hospitals serves over 1 million residents in Zagazig district and neighboring towns. The study spanned the time period from November 2018 till the end of February 2019, a period with known peak incidence of ILI attacks. Subjects of ≥ 56 years were recruited from the visitors of outpatient clinics at Zagazig University Hospitals. The age of ≥ 56 years was used by the WHO to define old age in African nations. In addition, this age is close to public service retirement in Egyptian society, which is associated with significant social, mental, and psychological stress and therefore could be associated with significant decline in NK cell activity. Only local residents of Zagazig district were recruited to the study so as to reduce the dropout rate. Originally 90 subjects, both males and females, were approached but only 80 subjects, 40 males and 40 females, continued the study. Ten of the recruits refused to participate when they realized that the sachets were only labeled with the manufacture symbols without printed names, which was used to ensure double‐blinding. Informed consents were obtained from all participants and their right to unconditionally withdraw from the study at any time were made clear to them. Males and females were randomly assigned into two groups (n=40/group) that received either placebo or Biobran/MGN‐3 (500 mg/day for 3 months). Both the health care giver and the participants were blinded to the ingested supplement. Participants' health was monitored via weekly home visits and they were instructed to report any complaints or side effects by phone to the health care giver. Diagnosis of ILI was made by documenting the incidence of acute respiratory illness with a measured temperature of ≥ 38 °C with cough (3). After diagnosis, the subject was helped to follow the proper health management plan by the health care giver. During the study, all participants were required not to take any vitamins or medications during the study without consultation. The effect of Biobran/MGN‐3 on liver, kidney, and hematological parameters were monitored. Liver functions were monitored using alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT), whereas kidney function was monitored using serum uric acid. The assessed hematological parameters included red blood cell count (RBC), hematocrit value (HCT), hemoglobin (Hb), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and total and differential (WBC). NKC activity was measured using the well documented degranulation assay. The viral nucleic acid receptors, RIG‐1 and MDA5, and their downstream target, ISG15 and MX1, were assessed using flowcytometry in BEAS‐2B cells.

AB  - [Purpose]
Enzyme-treated rice bran hemicellulose (MGN3, Biobran) is a partial hydrolyzate obtained by the action of basidiomycete enzymes on the water-soluble hemicellulose of rice bran. So far, it has been clarified to have various physiological functions. However, sufficient research has not been conducted on the effect it has on liver damage. A study was conducted to clarify the effect of MGN3 on liver injury. In this study, we investigated its effects on the development of experimental liver injury in rats caused by galactosamine (GalN) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
[Methods]
Experiment 1. SLC Wistar male clean rats (4 weeks old), which are particularly sensitive to GalN, were used. The rats were preliminarily bred for 1 week, divided into 3 groups of 8 rats each, and allowed to freely ingest a control diet or a diet containing 1% MGN-3 for 14 days. After this breeding period, 400 mg/kg of GalN was administered intraperitoneally, and after 24 hours the serum GOT and GPT activities were measured.
Experiment 2. Claire Wistar male SPF rats (4 weeks old) were preliminarily bred for several days, divided into 3 groups of 5 rats each, and fed a commercially available solid diet (CLEA CE2) for the duration of the experiment. ) freely. These rats were intraperitoneally injected with MGN3 at a dose of 40 mg/kg, followed by an intraperitoneal injection of GalN at 800 mg/kg one hour later. Serum transaminase (GOT, GPT) activities of these rats were measured 24 hours after GalN administration. In the control group, instead of the MGN3 aqueous solution, the same dose of physiological saline was intraperitoneally administered, and Ga1N was administered as in the MGN3 group.
Experiment 3. Claire Wistar male SPF rats (4 weeks old) were preliminarily reared for several days, divided into 3 groups of 5 rats each, and fed commercially available chow (Clare CE2) were given ad libitum. MGN3 was administered intraperitoneally to these rats at a dose of 40 mg/kg, and 1 hour later, 300 mg/kg of GalN and 20 μg/kg of LPS were intraperitoneally administered simultaneously. Serum transaminase (GOT, GPT) activities of these rats were measured 24 hours after administration. In the control group, instead of the MGN3 aqueous solution, the same volume of physiological saline was intraperitoneally administered, and GalN and LPS were administered in the same manner as in the MGN3 group.
[Results and Discussion]
Experiment 1. In the MGN3 group, serum GOT and GPT activities were significantly increased compared to the control group, suggesting that the onset of GalN liver injury was enhanced. So far, in a similar experimental system, it has been clarified that the onset of GalN liver damage is suppressed by feeding 5% corn hemicellulose. Since MGN3 is included as a component, a similar inhibitory effect was expected for MGN3, but in this experiment, an enhancing effect was conversely shown. Since MGN3 has immune function activating effects such as activation of NK cells, it is possible that it promoted the onset of GalN liver injury from an immunological perspective. In disorders, it is conceivable that the activation of NK cells may facilitate the elimination of virus-infected cells.
Experiment 2. Intraperitoneal administration of MGN3 1 hour before GalN administration significantly inhibited the elevation of serum GOT and GPT activities due to liver injury. Since the pathogenesis of GalN liver injury is thought to be due to metabolic and immunological abnormalities, it was suggested that MGN3 contains components that suppress these abnormalities. In Experiment 1, MGN3 promoted the elevation of both transaminase activities, but in this single intraperitoneal administration experiment, it was suppressed. It was shown that the effect of MGN3 was different in different cases.
Experiment 3. MGN3 was administered intraperitoneally 1 hour before administration of GalN/LPS, but had almost no effect on the elevation of serum GOT and GPT activities due to liver damage. It was different from the result of Experiment 2. Since LPS affects the immune system, the effect of MGN3 on GalN liver damage observed in experiment 2 is not an immunological effect but rather a result of oxidative stress. It was presumed that this was due to the inhibitory effect on metabolic disorders, including stress.

AB  - Background and objectives: Hepatitis is a serious health problem worldwide associated with significant morbidity. DGalactosamine (GalN) /LPS induces acute hepatitis in mice. Hydrolyzed rice bran (HRB) is a modified water soluble arabinoxylan from rice bran that can be obtained by partial hydrolysis with carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes from shiitake mushrooms. However, the effects of HRB on GalN/LPS induced hepatitis have not yet been clarified. In this study, we investigated the effect of HRB on GalN/LPS-induced hepatitis in mice.
Methods: Male ddY mice (6-wl-old) were fed a diet containing 0, 6 or 60 mg% HRB for 1 week. On the last day, the mice were treated with GalN/LPS and 6 h later the mice were killed. The serum transaminase activities were determined by a Transaminase C-test Wako kit. Serum IL-18 concentration and hepatic IL-18 mRNA expression were analyzed by ELISA kit and real-time PCR, respectively. To determine whether the inhibitory action of HRB was due to its effect on IkBa degradation, the cytoplasmic levels of IkBa protein were measured by western blot analysis.
Results: The dose of 6 mg% HRB was found to significantly alleviate the increase of serum AST activity and IL-18 concentration in GalN/LPS-intoxicated mice. The significant increase of AST activity was found to be accompanied with the elevation of hepatic IL-18 mRNA expression and serum IL-18 concentration. Furthermore, HRB abrogated IkBa degradation induced by GalN/LPS, and this was associated with the inhibition of NF-kB activation.
Conclusions: These results showed that HRB could provide a significant protection against GalN/LPS induced hepatitis, and IL-18 and inhibition of NF-kB pathway might be involved in the protective influence of HRB.

AB  - Influenza-like illness (ILI) remains a major cause of severe mortality and morbidity in the elderly. Aging is associated with a decreased ability to sense pathogens and mount effective innate and adaptive immune responses, thus mandating the development of protective nutraceuticals. Biobran/MGN-3, an arabinoxylan from rice bran, has potent anti-aging and immunomodulatory effects, suggesting that it may be effective against ILI. The objective of the current study was to investigate the effect of Biobran/MGN-3 on ILI incidence, natural killer (NK) cell activity, and the expressions of RIG-1 (retinoic acid-inducible gene 1), MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5), and their downstream signaling genes ISG-15 (interferon-stimulated genes 15) and MX1 (myxovirus (influenza) resistance 1, interferon-inducible). A double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial included eighty healthy older adults over 55 years old, 40 males and 40 females, who received either a placebo or Biobran/MGN-3 (500 mg/day) for 3 months during known ILI seasonality (peak incidence) in Egypt. The incidence of ILI was confirmed clinically according to the WHO case definition criteria. Hematological, hepatic, and renal parameters were assessed in all subjects, while the activity of NK and NKT (natural killer T) cells was assessed in six randomly chosen subjects in each group by the degranulation assay. The effect of Biobran/MGN-3 on RIG-1 and MDA5, as well as downstream ISG15 and MX1, was assessed in BEAS-2B pulmonary epithelial cells using flow cytometry. The incidence rate and incidence density of ILI in the Biobran/MGN-3 group were 5.0% and 0.57 cases per 1000 person-days, respectively, compared to 22.5% and 2.95 cases per 1000 person-days in the placebo group. Furthermore, Biobran/MGN-3 ingestion significantly enhanced NK activity compared to the basal levels and to the placebo group. In addition, Biobran/MGN-3 significantly upregulated the expression levels of RIG-1, MDA5, ISG15, and MX1 in the human pulmonary epithelial BEAS-2B cell lines. No side effects were observed. Taken together, Biobran/MGN-3 supplementation enhanced the innate immune response of elderly subjects by upregulating the NK activity associated with reduction of ILI incidence. It also upregulated the intracellular RIG-1, MDA5, ISG15, and MX1 expression in pulmonary epithelial tissue cultures. Biobran/MGN-3 could be a novel agent with prophylactic effects against a wide spectrum of respiratory viral infections that warrants further investigation.

AB  - PURPOSE: The world's older population is growing rapidly and the need to find measures to combat age-associated decline of physical, mental, and cognitive functions and improve their health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is escalating. Biobran/MGN-3, an arabinoxylan rice bran, has been previously reported to improve the quality of life in cancer patients. The objective of the current study was to examine the effect of a low dose of Biobran/MGN-3 supplementation on the HRQOL in a healthy older adult population. METHODS: Sixty apparently healthy subjects, 40 males and 20 females, over 56 years old were recruited and blindly randomized into two group receiving either placebo or Biobran/MGN-3 (250 mg/day for 3 months). Participants did not take any vitamins or medications during the study and their health was closely monitored. HRQOL was assessed at the initiation and termination of the study using the previously validated Arabic version of SF-12v2 questionnaire. RESULTS: For all measured HRQOL domains, there was no statistically significant difference in baseline scores between the two groups. Compared to baseline values and placebo-treated subjects, Biobran/MGN-3 supplementation significantly enhanced the levels of physical and mental component summary scores as well as role-physical, bodily pain, vitality, and social functioning subdomain scores. CONCLUSION: These results show that Biobran/MGN-3 is a promising psychoneuroimmune modulatory agent that could improve the HRQOL in healthy old adults.

AB  - Aging is associated with a decline in natural killer (NK) and natural killer T (NKT) cell function that may contribute to increased susceptibility to malignancy and infection. A preliminary investigation was conducted examining the hypothesis that arabinoxylan rice bran (Biobran/MGN-3), a denatured hemicellulose with known immunomodulatory activity, could counteract this decline in NK/NKT cell activity in geriatrics. A total of 12 healthy geriatric subjects of both sexes and over 56 years old, participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. A total of six subjects served as control and six subjects ingested Biobran/MGN-3 (500 mg/day) for 30 days. The effect of Biobran/MGN-3 supplementation on NK/NKT cell activity was assessed using the degranulation assay. All study subjects were monitored for the development of any inadvertent side effects. In addition, the pharmacological effects of Biobran/MGN-3 on blood cell components and liver and kidney functions were also assessed. Results demonstrated that Biobran/MGN-3 had no effect on the total percentage of NK cells, however it enhanced the cytotoxic activity of induced NK cell expression of cluster of differentiation 107a, when compared with baseline values and with the placebo group (P<0.05). Furthermore, there were no side effects observed, indicating that Biobran/MGN-3 supplementation was safe at the utilized dosage and for the duration of administration. Various additional beneficial effects were observed, including improved mean corpuscular volume and reduced hepatic aspartate aminotransferase enzyme levels, which suggested improved liver function. It was concluded that Biobran/MGN-3 induces a significant increase in NK activity which may increase resistance to viral infections and cancers in the geriatric population. However, additional clinical trials should be conducted in the future to verify these findings.

AB  - Alkylating agents and antimetabolites remain prominent in a wide variety of cancer chemotherapy protocols on the basis of more selective effects on the faster than normal mitotic cycles of malignant cells. Among new platinum-containing anticancer molecules, the lead compound cisplatin (Cis-platinum (II) diammine dichloride) has been known to possess beneficial anticancer properties in terms of specific interaction of cisplatin and DNA strands. Cisplatin (Rosenberg et al. 1969) has been encouraged for treatment of head and neck, bladder, and cervical cancers (Loehrer & Einhorn 1984), as well as breast cancer (Smith & Talbot 1992). Although the prevalent incidence of lung, gastric, breast, colorectal and prostate cancers place them in top ranks of the most common cancers in the civilized countries, many of these advanced cancers are unresponsive to chemotherapy. Platinum-based drugs would be a potent choice in these situations, but they frequently cause substantial side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, nephropathy and hypomagnesaemia due to damage of renal tubules (Lajer & Daugaard 1999). Furthermore, in addition to hearing loss and peripheral neuropathy, myelosuppression is one of the most devastating suppressive side-effects (Prestayko et al. 1979) leading to immunocompromized states. Therefore, any reduction of the side effects of cisplatin would be valuable. Thus, we explored the effect of modified rice bran on protection of weight loss of mice under tolerable maximal doses of cisplatin. Others have briefly commented on the antistress and antifatigue effects of fermented rice bran (Kim et al. 2001) or some beneficial effect of modified rice bran on some adverse actions of anticancer drugs in rats (Jacoby et al. 2000).

AB  - Arabinoxylane from rice bran (MGN-3) was examined for its augmentory effect on human NK (NK) cell activity in vivo and in vitro. Twenty-four individuals were given MGN-3 orally at three different concentrations: 15, 30 and 45 mg/kg/day for 2 months. Peripheral blood lymphocyte-NK cell activity was tested by super(51)Cr release assay against K562 and Raji tumor cells at 1 week, 1 month and 2 months posttreatment and results were compared with baseline NK activity. Treatment with MGN-3 enhanced NK activity against K562 tumor cells at all concentrations used. In a dose-dependent manner, MGN-3 at 15 mg/kg/day increased NK activity after 1 month posttreatment (twofold over control value), while significant induction of NK activity at 30 mg/kg/day was detected as early as 1 week posttreatment (three times control value). NK cell activity continued to increase with continuation of treatment and peaked (fivefold) at 2 months (end of treatment period). Increasing the concentration to 45 mg/kg/day showed similar trends in NK activity, however the magnitude in values was higher than for 30 mg/kg/day. After discontinuation of treatment, NK activity declined and returned to baseline value (14 lytic units) at 1 month. Enhanced NK activity was associated with an increase in the cytotoxic reactivity against the resistant Raji cell line. MGN-3 at 45 mg/kg/day showed a significant increase in NK activity after 1 week (eightfold) and peaked at 2 months posttreatment (27 times that of baseline). Culture of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) with MGN-3 for 16 h demonstrated a 1.3 to 1.5 times increase in NK activity over control value. The mechanism by which MGN-3 increases NK activity was examined and showed no change in cluster of differentiation (CD)16 super(+) and CD56 super(+) CD3 super(-) of MGN-3-activated NK cells as compared with baseline value; a four-fold increase in the binding capacity of NK to tumor cell targets as compared with baseline value; and a significant increase in the production of interferon- gamma (340-580 pg/ml) postculture of PBL with MGN-3 at concentrations of 25-100 mu g/ml. Thus, MGN-3 seems to act as a potent immunomodulator causing augmentation of NK cell activity, and with the absence of notable side-effects, MGN-3 could be used as a new biological response modifier (BRM) having possible therapeutic effects against cancer.

AB  - MGN-3 an arabinoxylane from rice bran that has been enzymatically modified with extract from Hyphomycetes mycelia, was tested for anti-HIV activity in vitro. MGN-3 activity against HIV-1 (SF strain) was examined in primary cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. MGN-3 inhibited HIV-1 replication by: (1) inhibition of HIV-1 p24 antigen production in a dose dependent manner--MGN-3 concentrations of 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 micrograms/ml showed 18.3, 42.8, 59, and 75% reduction in p24 antigen, respectively; and (2) inhibition of syncytia formation maximized (75%) at concentrations of 100 micrograms/ml. Further studies showed that ingestion of MGN-3 at concentration of 15 mg/kg/day resulted in a significant increase in T and B cell mitogen response at 2 months after treatment: 146% for PHA, 140% for Con A, and 136.6% for PWM mitogen. We conclude that MGN-3 possesses potent anti-HIV activity and in the absence of any notable side effects, MGN-3 shows promise as an agent for treating patients with AIDS.

AB  - Several studies have established the excessive cancer risk for workers exposed to several widespread workplace chemicals. The present study was designed to examine the immune alteration associated with exposure to toxic chemicals and possible counteracting of chemical toxicity using MGN-3. MGN-3 is a new biological response modifier (BRM) that consists of arabinoxylan compound, which is a polysaccharide that contains hemicellulose-・extract of rice bran, modified by enzymes from shiitake mushrooms.
Eleven individuals who had been exposed to chemicals in the workplace participated in the study. The participants demonstrated immune dysfunction as indicated by: low levels of natural killer (NK) cell activity (10.2±4.2 LUs), lymphocyte blastogenic responses to T-cell mitogens (PHA, 39060±12517 cpm and CONA, 36224±11922 cpm) and B-cell mitogen (PWM, 16550±6330 cpm), compared to control responses. Subjects received MGN-3 at a dose of 15 mg/kg/d for four months. Treatment with MGN-3 increased NK cell activity 4 and 7 fold at two and four months respectively, while T and B-cell functions were 130-150% higher than base line values.
NK cell immunomodulatory function by MGN-3 was also examined in ninety (90) patients with different types of malignancies: prostate(22), breast(20), multiple myeloma(16), ovary(5), and other organs(27). Patients received and completed conventional therapy such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiation or hormonal therapy prior to participation in the study. NK cell activity was serially monitored in a monthly basis using K562, a human erythroleukemic cell target. Patients received MGN-3 at dose 45 mg/kg/d for 2-5 years. In clinical MGN-3 trials, 95.5% of patients (86/90) demonstrated an augmentation of NK activity (2-10 fold increase of baseline) at 1-2 weeks post treatment. The activity was maintained at a high level for up to 5 years. The effect of stress during human NK cell immunomodulation by MGN-3 is worth investigation, since stress is known to be a strong immune depressant. During the course of treatment with MGN-3, 11.6% of the responders (10/86) suffered from different kinds of stressors, such as: sleep deprivation, bereavement following the loss of a spouse or close relative, work overload or financial problems. These patients evidence 40-75% decrease in their NK activity as compared to the previous level. After elimination of some stressors, the NK activity increased back to the former value.
We conclude that 1) MGN-3 is a new BRM that does offer a new immunotherapeutic approach to cancer by increasing host anti-tumor responses through an augmentation of the NK cell activity. 2) Suppression in NK activity by chemical exposure can be fully restored with MGN-3. 3) Our preliminary results suggest that stress cause immune suppression during the course of MGN-3 treatment. Monitoring NK activity on a monthly basis will be able to detect this suppression which requires correction, otherwise it will have definite future clinical ramifications.

AB  - The present study is aimed to examine the possibility of enhancement of natural killer (NK) cell activity in aged C57BL/6 and C3H mice using MGN-3, a modified arabinoxylan from rice bran. Intraperitoneal injection of MGN-3 (10 mg kg(-1) per day) caused a remarkable increase in the peritoneal NK activity as early as 2 days (35.2 lytic units), and the level remained elevated through day 14. The control aged mice had a level of 5.8 lytic units. Enhancement in NK activity was associated with an increase in both the binding capacity of NK cells to tumour targets and in the granular content as measured by BLT-esterase activity. Treatment did not alter the percentage of peritoneal NK cells. Data showed that peritoneal macrophages inhibit NK activity. In conclusion, MGN-3 enhances murine NK activity of aged mice and may be useful for enhancing NK function in aged humans.

AB  - Arabinoxylan rice bran (MGN-3/Biobran) is a potent biological response modifier (BRM) that activates natural killer (NK) cells, T cells and monocytes. Currently, little is known regarding the effects of MGN-3 on dendritic cells (DCs), the cell type that bridges innate and adaptive immunity. Therefore, we examined the stimulatory effects of MGN-3 on DCs. Human monocyte-derived DCs were treated with MGN-3 at different concentrations (5-20 microg/ml) for 24 hours in vitro. Activation of DCs was determined by assessing the expression of co-stimulatory and maturation markers (CD40, CD80, CD83, CD86 and HLA-DR) by flow cytometry, and production of cytokines by ELISA. DC function was determined by assessing their ability to activate naïve T cells. Activation of T cells was assessed by measuring cell proliferation and cytokine production. MGN-3 treatment, in a dose-dependent manner, resulted in: 1) up-regulation of the surface expression of CD83 and CD86, on DCs; 2) an increase in the production of pro-inflammatory and immuno-regulatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, IL-12p40 and low levels of IL-12p70 and IL-2) by DCs; and 3) MGN-3 stimulated DC induced CD4+T cell proliferation and their production of cytokines, IFN-gamma, IL-10, IL-17. Results suggest that MGN-3 functions as a natural adjuvant for DC activation and thus may be used in DC-based vaccine strategies against infections and cancer.

AB  - Arabinoxylan rice bran (MGN-3/Biobran) has been shown to be a potent biological response modifier (BRM) that activates different arms of the immune system, including dendritic cells (DCs), which prime CD4+ helper T-cell responses. The present study explores the ability of MGN-3-activated DCs to prime CD8+ T cells and examines the mechanisms underlying its effect. Human monocyte-derived DCs were treated with MGN-3 (20 and 40 mg/L). Results indicate that treatment with MGN-3 caused DCs to prime higher granzyme B-expressing CD8+ T cells. Tumor lysate-pulsed MGN-3 DC also increased tumor cell killing compared to DC-stimulated CD8+ T cells. This was associated with: i) increased expression of DEC-205 in MGN-3-activated DCs in a dose-dependent manner; and ii) MGN-3 induced significant production of Type III interferon, IL29, but not Type I IFNs alpha and beta. These results suggest that MGN-3 is a potent natural adjuvant that efficiently activates DCs and may therefore be useful for mounting an efficient immune response against infections and cancer.

AB  - The aim of the current study is to examine the protective effect of MGN-3 on overall maintenance of hematopoietic tissue after gamma -irradiation. MGN-3 is an arabinoxylan from rice bran that has been shown to be a powerful antioxidant and immune modulator. Swiss albino mice were treated with MGN-3 prior to irradiation and continued to receive MGN-3 for 1 or 4 weeks. Results were compared with mice that received radiation (5 Gy gamma rays) only, MGN-3 (40 mg/kg) only and control mice (receiving neither radiation nor MGN-3). At 1 and 4 weeks post-irradiation, different hematological, histopathological and biochemical parameters were examined. Mice exposed to irradiation alone showed significant depression in their complete blood count (CBC) except for neutrophilia. Additionally, histopathological studies showed hypocellularity of their bone marrow, as well as a remarkable decrease in splenic weight/relative size and in number of megakaryocytes. In contrast, pre-treatment with MGN-3 resulted in protection against irradiation-induced damage to the CBC parameters associated with complete bone marrow cellularity, as well as protection of the aforementioned splenic changes. Furthermore, MGN-3 exerted antioxidative activity in whole-body irradiated mice, and provided protection from irradiation-induced loss of body and organ weight. In conclusion, MGN-3 has the potential to protect progenitor cells in the bone marrow, which suggests the possible use of MGN-3/Biobran as an adjuvant treatment to counteract the severe adverse side effects associated with radiation therapy.

AB  - Background: There is an increased interest in alternative treatments that reduce the toxicity of chemotherapy by lowering the drug concentration, whilst maintaining potency against cancer cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that arabinarylan from rice bran, MGN-3/Biobran, sensitizes human breast cancer cells (BCC) to daunorubicin (DNR). In the present study, we further evaluated the ability of MGN-3 to sensitize cells to another chemotherapy agent, paclitaxel. Materials and Methods: Non-metastatic MCF-7 (human BCC) and metastatic 4T1 (murine BCC) cells were cultured with different concentrations of paclitaxel in the presence or absence of MGN-3. Cell survival, DNA damage, and cell proliferation were examined. Results: MGN-3 increased the susceptibility of both types of cancer cells to paclitaxel by over 100-fold. Mechanistically, MGM-3 works synergistically with paclitaxel by causing DNA damage, enhancing apoptosis, and inhibiting cell proliferation in 4T1 cells. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that MGN-3 is an effective chemosensitizer and may represent a novel adjuvant for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.

AB  - NK cells have been characterized as non-B cells or non-T cells lacking the characteristics of mature macrophages which develop from the bone marrow independently of thymic influence. NK cells play a crucial role in tumor rejection, immune surveillance, resistance to infections, and immune regulation. NK cell destruction of cancer cells involves a sequence of events. First, the NK cell recognizes and binds to the cancer cell. This process requires receptor-to-receptor interaction. Next, the NK cell releases granules which penetrate the cancer cell and ultimately kill it. The NK cell is then free to bind to another cancer cell and repeat the same process. However, cancer cells know how to fight back in a sort of cell war. We found for the first time in our laboratory that cancer cells can destroy WBCs through the phenomenon of phagocytosis. We have observed three ways in which this is done. The cancer cell can extend two arms around the WBC or it can develop a cup-shaped opening where the WBC is drawn inside. A third way is for the cancer cell to extend a long arm to capture the WBC and finally draw it inside the cancer cell where it is digested. In addition, extensive work by others has shown that cancer cells secrete immune-suppressive substances which inhibit the function of the immune system. Many attempts have been made in the last 25 years to strengthen the power of the immune system using different biological response modifiers (BRMs). These are substances originating from bacteria and fungi which possess immunoaugmentory properties. In addition, some kinds of cytokines serve as BRMS such as interferons, interleukin-2 and interleukin-12.  There are two problems associated with these BRMS: 1st) toxicity and 2nd) the development of hyporesponsiveness in which a single administration of the BRM can significantly enhance NK cell activity, but that repeated administration of the same BRM results in depression of NK cell activity.  It is interesting to note that MGN-3 has advantages over other BRMs. It is nontoxic and has not shown hyporesponsiveness in the four years that the patients have been followed. This work was undertaken in order to investigate the augmentory effect of a new BRM known as MGN-3 on NK cell function and T and B cell proliferation in 32 patients. Tumor-associated antigens were reported for selected patients.

AB  - Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a debilitating and irreversible brain disease that affects an increasing number of aged individuals, mandating the development of protective nutraceuticals. Biobran/MGN-3, an arabinoxylan from rice bran, has potent antioxidant, antiaging, and immunomodulatory effects. The aim of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of Biobran against sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (SAD). SAD was induced in mice via intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (3 mg/kg). STZ-treated mice were administered with Biobran for 21 days. The effects of Biobran on memory and learning were measured via the Morris water maze, novel object recognition, and Y-maze tests. Biomarkers for apoptosis, oxidative stress, and amyloidogenesis were measured using ELISA and western blot analysis. Histopathological examination was performed to confirm neuronal damage and amyloid-beta deposition. Biobran reversed the spatial memory deficit in SAD-induced mice, and it increased the expression of glutathione, reduced malondialdehyde, decreased IL-6, decreased intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and significantly increased nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and antioxidant response element (ARE). Moreover, Biobran exerted a protective effect against amyloid-beta-induced apoptosis via the suppression of both cleaved caspase-3 and the proapoptotic protein Bax and via the upregulation of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Furthermore, it reduced the expression of forkhead box class O proteins. It could be concluded from this study that Biobran may be a useful nutritional antioxidant agent for protection against SAD through its activation of the gene expression of Nrf2/ARE, which in turn modulates the apoptotic and amyloidogenic pathways.

AB  - MGN-3, an arabinoxylan extracted from rice bran that is treated enzymatically with an extract from Shiitaki mushrooms, is an effective biological response modifier that increases NK cell activity, and potentiates the activity of conventional chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, we investigated the effect of MGN-3 on death receptor-induced apoptosis in the human leukemic HUT 78 cell line. HUT 78 cells were pre-treated with MGN-3, and then were incubated with the agonistic antibody against death receptor (Fas, CD95). Apoptosis was determined by the propidium iodide technique using FACScan. Activation of caspase 3, caspase 8, and caspase 9 was determined by flow cytometry. Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured with DIOC(6) dye using FACScan. Expression of CD95 and Bcl-2 were measured by flow cytometry. In a dose-dependent manner, MGN-3 enhanced anti-CD95 antibody-induced apoptosis. Increased cell death was correlated with increased depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased activation of caspase 3, caspase 8, and caspase 9. MGN-3 treatment had no effect on the level of expression of CD95, but it caused down regulation of Bcl-2 expression. These results suggest that MGN-3 increases the susceptibility of cancer cells to undergo apoptosis mediated by death ligands, which may be relevant for anti-cancer activities.

AB  - We have recently reported that phagocytosis of killed Saccharomyces cerevisiae, baker's yeast, induced apoptosis in human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, ZR-75-1 and HCC70. In this study we have evaluated the effect of treatment with MGN-3, a modified arabinoxylan from rice bran, on phagocytosis and yeast-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Cancer cells were cultured with yeast at a ratio of 1:10 in the absence or presence of MGN-3, and the percentages of phagocytic and apoptotic cancer cells were examined by flow cytometry and by cytospin preparations. Cancer cells treated with MGN-3 exhibited increased percentages of attachment (200%) and uptake of yeast (313%) by MCF-7 cells at 0.5 hr, as compared with cells without MGN-3. In addition, treatment with MGN-3 resulted in a 2 fold increase in the percentage of apoptotic MCF-7 cells, 2.5 fold for ZR-75 cells and 1.8 fold for HCC70 cells. MGN-3 effect was dose-dependent and associated with increased activation of caspases 8 and 9 in MCF-7 cells, and caspases 8, 9 and 3 in HCC70 cells. This data demonstrates that MGN-3 accelerates phagocytosis-induced apoptosis of cancer cells, which may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of breast cancer.

AB  - We have recently demonstrated that breast cancer cell (BCC) lines undergo apoptosis following phagocytosis of S. cerevisiae. Arabinoxylan rice bran extract (MGN-3/Biobran) has been shown to enhance this effect. Since previous data were obtained using cells in suspension, the present study was undertaken to examine monolayer BCC that more closely model cancer cell growth. Monolayers of both breast cancer (MCF-7) and non-tumorgenic breast epithelial (MCF-10A) cells grown on glass coverslips were cultured with heat-killed S. cerevisiae at a ratio of 1:10, respectively. MCF-7 cells phagocytized yeast in a time-dependent manner, 6.9% to 14.3% from 1 h to 4 h, respectively, with a 2-fold increase in the presence of MGN-3. On the other hand, there was virtually no phagocytosis of yeast by MCF-10A cells. Similarly, yeast-induced apoptosis of MCF-7 cells occurred in a time-dependent manner, from 11.5% after 1 h to 21.7% after 4 h, and was enhanced in the presence of MGN-3. These data may have implications in the treatment of breast cancer.

AB  - The present study was carried out to investigate the synergistic apoptotic potential of arabinoxylan rice bran (MGN-3/Biobran) and curcumin (turmeric) on human multiple myeloma (MM) cell line U266 , in vitro. U266 cells were cultured with MGN-3 (50 or 100μg/ml) and curcumin (2.5-10μM) for 3 days. The effects of MGN-3 and curcumin on the growth and survival of the U266 cells were determined by trypan blue, MTT assay, flow cytometry analysis of cancer cell cycle, and apoptosis. Expression of proapoptotic Bax, and antiapoptotic Bcl2 was determined by Western blot analysis. Treatment with MGN-3 alone or curcumin alone caused a dose-dependent inhibition in the proliferation of U266 cells. However, a synergistic effect was noticed post-treatment with both agents that maximized at 100μg/ml MGN-3 plus 10μM curcumin. This synergy was characterized by an 87% decrease in cell number and a 2.6 fold increase in the percentage of apoptotic U266 cells. Cell cycle analysis showed a 53% decrease in the percentage of cells in the G0-G1 phase treated with MGN-3 and curcumin (from 36% to 17%). Analysis of the expression of the pro and antiapoptotic molecules Bax and Bcl-2 revealed synergistic effects of these agents, as the expression of Bcl-2 was decreased and Bax was increased. This resulted in a cellular microenvironment favorable for apoptosis. We conclude that MGN-3 and curcumin synergize in the induction of U266 cell apoptosis. This data may establish the foundation for in vivo studies that could have therapeutic implications.

AB  - Recently, we presented evidence for the role of MGN-3, an enzymatically modified arabinoxylan extracted from rice bran, in potent activation of human natural killer (NK) cell function in vivo and in vitro. In the current study, we examined the mechanism by which MGN-3 elevated NK cytotoxic activity. We did this by testing the action of MGN-3 on the levels of both tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) secretions and MGN-3 function on the expression of key cell surface receptors. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were treated with MGN-3 at concentrations of 0.1 mg/ml and 1 mg/ml, and supernatants were subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results showed that MGN-3 is a potent TNF-alpha inducer. The effect was dose-dependent. MGN-3 concentration at 0.1 and 1 mg/ml increased TNF-alpha production by 22.8- and 47. 1-fold, respectively. MGN-3 also increased production of IFN-gamma but at lower levels as compared to TNF-alpha With respect to key cell surface receptors, MGN-3 increases the expression of CD69, an early activation antigen at 16 hours after treatment. Furthermore, the interleukin-2 receptor CD25 and the adhesion molecule ICAM-1 (CD54) were upregulated after treatment with MGN-3. Treating highly purified NK cells with MGN-3 also resulted in increased levels of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma secretion in conjunction with augmentation of NK cell cytotoxic function. Furthermore, addition of MGN-3 to interleukin-2-activated NK cells resulted in a synergistic induction of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma secretion. Overall, our data suggest that MGN-3, a novel biological response modifier, can be used as a safe alternative or as an adjuvant to the existing immunotherapeutic modalities.

AB  - MGN-3/Biobran, modified arabinoxylan rice bran, has been shown to be a potent biological response modifier (BRM) as manifested by stimulation of different arms of the immune system such as NK, T and B cells; however, its effect on macrophages has not yet been studied. The effects of MGN-3 on macrophage function was examined in vitro using 3 models: human macrophage cell line U937, murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7, and murine peritoneal macrophages (P-M phi). Treatment with MGN-3 resulted in an increase in the percentages of attachment and phagocytosis of yeast by macrophages. The effect depends on the type of macrophage and the dose of MGN-3 applied. Macrophages also demonstrated enhancement in their spreading ability, post treatment with MGN-3. Results also showed that MGN-3, in a dose dependent manner (1, 10,100 microg/ml), significantly induced high levels of production of cytokines: TNF-alpha; and IL-6. In addition, MGN-3 significantly increased nitric oxide (NO) production. This data demonstrates that MGN-3 is a potent inducer of phagocytic function by macrophage, and suggests that MGN-3 is a useful agent for fighting microbial infection.

AB  - Phagocytic cells, comprised of neutrophils and moncytyes/macrophages, play a key role in the innate immune response to infection. Our earlier study demonstrated that arabinoxylan rice bran (MGN-3/Biobran) activates murine peritoneal macrophage and macrophage cell lines. In this study, we investigated whether MGN-3 can upregulate the phagocytic activity of human phagocytes in peripheral blood to phagocytize Escherichia coli (E. coli), trigger the oxidative burst and produce cytokines. Phagocytic cells were pre-labeled with dichlorofluorescin diacetate dye and were incubated with phycoerythrin-Iabeled E. coli in the presence or absence of MGN-3. Phagocytosis and oxidative burst were assessed by flow cytometry. Results showed that treatment with MGN-3 enhanced the phagocytosis of E. coli by neutrophils and moncytes. This was associated with an increased oxidative burst. In addition, it caused a significant induction of cytokines (TNF- alpha , IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10); the effect was detected at 1 mu g/ml and increased in a dose-dependent manner (P less than or equal to 0.01). Notably, MGN-3 alone had no effect on the growth of 31 strains of bacteria suggesting that MGN-3 modulates phagocytic cellular function. These findings may have applications in the treatment of infections in the elderly and in immunocompromised patients.

AB  - Recent advances in research on MGN-3 showed that in addition to having potent immunomodulatory function and anti-HIV activity, this compound can be effective in directly targeting certain cancer cells. MGN-3 is a new biological response modifier (BRM) that is an arabinoxylan compound which is a polysaccharide containing hemicellulose-extract of rice bran modified by enzymes from Shiitake mushroom.
In the present preliminary study, the direct effects of MGN-3 on skin cancer cell growth and cytokine production were evaluated. Incubation of a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC13) cell line with MGN-3 arrested tumor cell growth (30% decrease in cell number after 48 hours and 50 % at 72 hours of culture) as compared to control SCC13 cells grown in a MEM media alone which continued to increase in cell number. Employing flow cytometry procedures, analyses showed that after 16 hours of treatment of SCC13 cells with MGN-3, there was a five-fold increase in intracellular levels of interleukin 10 (IL-10), but no apparent change in content of interferon-γ(INF-γ). ELIZA analyses showed higher (8-fold) levels of IL-10 and a 3-fold increase in IL-12 in the culture media of SCC13 cells. However, little change in INF-γ concentration was detected. The effects of MGN-3 on other cell lines, such as normal and tumor breast cells and prostate cancer cells, were also evaluated.
In conclusion, our findings indicate that MGN-3 acts by not only enhancing the host immune function but also through a direct alteration of tumor cell growth and production of cytokines. These findings may offer a mechanism of action which could explain the high clinical success and impressive benefits of MGN-3 treatment obsearved with 32 patients over 4 years.

AB  - This article provides a controlled evaluation of the ability of dietary supplementation with a commercially available rice bran extract modified with shitake mushroom extract (MGN-3) to support the immune function by assessing the ability of immunocytes to proliferate and produce cytokines in response to a mitogenic challenge. Twenty-four male Lewis rats were fed a control diet (Maypo sweetened oatmeal) or Maypo containing the recommended daily dose of MGN-3 for 2 weeks. This treatment modestly enhanced mitogen enhanced proliferation of splenocytes and interferon-gamma (IFN-g) production, and significantly increased proliferation of splenocytes to the superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) as well as natural killer (NK) cell activity and production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) by stimulated lymphocytes. These data support the contention that ingestion of MGN-3 can support immune cell function. These data add to a growing body of data showing that ingestion of MGN-3 improves the ability of immune cells to proliferate the lyse tumor cells, suggesting that it may have utility as a dietary aid to support the immune system.

AB  - BACKGROUND: MGN-3/Biobran, a modified form of arabinoxylan from rice bran, is a potent biological response modifier (BRM). Our previous studies demonstrated that MGN-3 sensitizes human leukemia cells to death receptor [CD95]-induced apoptosis [Ghoneum M, Gollapudi S. MGN-3 sensitizes human T cell leukemia cells to death receptor (CD95)-induced apoptosis. Cancer Lett 2003;201:41-9]. In this study, we evaluated the chemo-sensitizing activity of MGN-3 against human breast cancer cells (BCCs) in vitro. METHODS: BCCs (MCF-7 and HCC70 cells) were cultured with different concentrations of daunorubicin (DNR) (from 1x10(-9) to 1x10(-6)M) in the presence or absence of selected concentrations of MGN-3 (100-1000mug/ml) for 3 days. Cancer cell survival was determined by MTT assay and drug accumulation was determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Treatment with MGN-3 increased susceptibility of BCCs to DNR (5.5-fold for MCF-7 and 2.5-fold for HCC70 cells) as compared to BCCs treated with DNR alone. The sensitizing effect of MGN-3 was associated with increased accumulation of DNR in cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that MGN-3 is an effective chemo-sensitizer and may represent a potential novel adjuvant for the treatment of breast cancer.

AB  - Hypothesis. Prior studies on patients with early B-cell lymphoid malignancies suggest that early intervention with curcumin may lead to delay in progressive disease and prolonged survival. These patients are characterized by increased susceptibility to infections. Rice bran arabinoxylan (Ribraxx) has been shown to have immunostimulatory, anti-inflammatory, and proapoptotic effects. We postulated that addition of Ribraxx to curcumin therapy may be of benefit. Study design. Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)/smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) or stage 0/1 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients who had been on oral curcumin therapy for a period of 6 months or more were administered both curcumin (as Curcuforte) and Ribraxx. Methods. Ten MGUS/SMM patients and 10 patients with stage 0/1 CLL were administered 6 g of curcumin and 2 g Ribraxx daily. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at 2-month intervals for a period of 6 months, and various markers were monitored. MGUS/SMM patients included full blood count (FBC); paraprotein; free light chains/ratio; C-reactive protein (CRP)and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR); B2 microglobulin and immunological markers. Markers monitored for stage 0/1 CLL were FBC, CRP and ESR, and immunological markers. Results. Of 10 MGUS/SMM patients,5 (50%) were neutropenic at baseline, and the Curcuforte/Ribraxx combination therapy showed an increased neutrophil count, varying between 10% and 90% among 8 of the 10 (80%) MGUS/SMM patients. An additional benefit of the combination therapy was the potent effect in reducing the raised ESR in 4 (44%) of the MGUS/SMM patients. Conclusion. Addition of Ribraxx to curcumin therapy may be of benefit to patients with early-stage B-cell lymphoid malignancies.

AB  - Background: Targeting hyperactive mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade has proven to be an effective treatment for a variety of different cancers. Using an important member of this cascade, namely MEK (mitogen activated extracellular signal regulation kinase) inhibitors, the clinical responses are often transient and complete remission is rarely observed. Outgrowth of resistant clones within progressed tumors appears to be inevitable. Recent immunological and clinical observations suggest that in background of this resistance the tumor-.induced disturbance of immunoregulation at least in part may play a role. Namely, it was shown that growth factor receptor signaling pathway inhibitors can increase the immune sensitivity of tumor cells, but they can’t activate the down regulated immune effectors. Consequently, the combination of MAPK cascade signaling pathway inhibitors and the immune effectors activating immunomodulators may be a promising new strategy. Material and methods: In a now 59 years old patient with inoperable (BRAF-mutant) low differentiated adenocarcinoma of bilary ducts after 30GY radiotherapy and two cycles (Gemcitabin+ Cisplatin) chemotherapy a rapid progression of lung, liver and brain metastases were by CT and MR established. Thereafter, a teatment with BRAF+MEK inhibitors (2x150 mg dabrafenib and 1 x 2 mg trametinib) was started. These inhibitors were combined with daily 45 mg/kg rice bran arabinoxylan concentrate (using Biobran/MGN-3) which was shown to be a pathogenic associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-like molecule and can stimulate the type-1 innate immune cells against tumor cells. Results: After the chemotherapy and prior to the start of second line treatment, the patient had a nearly terminal state of her rapidly progressive disease. Eight months after the combination of MEK / BRAF inhibitor and immunomodulator therapy nearly complete remissions of all metastases was established in CT and MR.
Conclusion: This case report may support a hypothesis that MEK / BRAF inhibitors and type-1 immune cells activating immunomodulators together may synergistic inhibit the tumor growth. Further clinical investigations are necessary to clarify this question.

AB  - Since malignant tumors parallel with their progression can lose their sensitivity against the MHC-I restricted T lymphocytes because of their escape in tumor antigen presenting, we need immunomodulators which are able to activate MHC-I unrestricted tumoricidal mechanisms of innate immune system. In contrast to the adaptive system, the innate immune cells have regularly a basic activity (priming) which can determine their function ability and render possible a polarity similar to neuroendocrine system. Namely, innate immune cells are committed in two directions. Type-1 cells involve tumoricidal cascade mechanisms which activate the MHC-I unrestricted killer cells (such as NK-cells) and Type-2 cells activate cell proliferation by production of Growth Factors (GFs), affect chronic inflammation, stimulate the angiogenesis and inhibit the type-1 system. As shown in this paper the activity of type 1 cells is down regulated parallel with the tumor progression and available information suggest a regular tumor-induced dominance of type-2 cells. Immunomodulators must improve this disturbed balance. Type-1 natural cells can be activated only via stimulation of phagocytic cells by PAMP like structures which have always a natural origin and the chemistry is not able to produce them. In the tumoricidal activity of MHC-I unrestricted killer cells the expression of NKG2D receptors and the expression of their stress related ligands (MICA/B, UBPL1-3) have pivotal regulatory role generating the kill signal. The aim of this review paper to support hypotheses as to whether an increase in expression of KAR on MHC-I unrestricted killer cells by evidence based plant immunomodulators and parallel stimulating the expression of stress related ligands on tumor cells by GFR inhibitors or cytostatic drugs (such as Gemcitabin) can result in clinical benefits. Case reports using standardized Rice Bran Arabinoxylan Concentrate (Biobran/MGN-3) in combination with GFR inhibitors or Gemcitabin show astonishing clinical responses. Unfortunately, in spite of clinical and immunological evidences this plant immunomodulator is registered only as food supplements and a further research of these hypotheses is therefore hindered.

AB  - Background: Growing evidence supports the hypothesis that similar to microbes various plant extracts can also contain Pathogenic Associated Molecular Pattern (PAMP)-like structures which can activate type-1 cellular functions of the innate immune system. Since they are important in tumor defense and the chemical production of PAMP structures is hardly accomplishable, the plant extracts standardized concerning their PAMP like structures may be promising for future tumor therapy. Method: The synergistic effect of two standardized plant immunomodulators was monitored by the hemocytological measurement of the peripheral level of Natural Killer (NK) cells. Suboptimal doses of mistletoe lectins (ML) and Arabinoxylan in MGN-3 were compared using healthy volunteers. Results: 24h after a single suboptimal dose (15 mg/kg) of Arabinoxylan in MGN-3 an average increase (+/-SEM) in NK level was 46.4 (+/-36)% and 24h after a single suboptimal (0.45 ng/kg) ML injection a 36 (+/-13) % enhancement was found. If these suboptimal doses of Arabinoxylan and ML were given together, a highly significant enhancement (293 +/-41%) was established indicating a high significant synergism between them (p<0.001). A patient with uterus and ovary sarcoma was not able to tolerate the CYVADIC chemotherapy. After its combination with ML and Arabinoxylan using optimal doses: 0.75 ng/kg and 45 mg/kg respectively, she received six cycles CYVADIC and thereafter only immunotherapy was given. During the following five years she has regularly been tumor free. Conclusion: The combination of standardized plant extracts with PAMP-like structures seems to open new perspectives in the supportive therapy of metastatic tumors. Further research is necessary.

AB  - Background: It is well documented that cancer cells are characterized by loss or down regulation of HLA-class-I molecules which are not reversible and reparable. It leads to a definitive escape of tumor cells from T cell lyse. Consequently, growing attention is focusing on the effector cells of innate immune system which are able to kill tumor cells in a non-MHC restricted manner. However, parallel with the tumor progression the tumor growth inhibiting type-1 innate immune cells are down regulated, in that among other reasons a tumor-associated dysregulation of EGF signaling can also play an important role.
Material and methods: Since a 74 year’s old patient with inoperable lung adenocarcinoma showed a progression after four cycles Carboplatin and Paclitaxel, a second line treatment with 75 mg/day Erlotinib (Terceva) was started and given for seven months. This tyrosin-kinase inhibitor of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) therapy was combined with standardized plant immunomodulators giving 0.75 ng/kg mistletoe lectin and 0.45 mg/kg arabinoxylan twice a week which were shown to be pathogenic associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-like molecules which can stimulate the type-1 innate immune cells.
Results: After the chemotherapy and prior to the start of second line treatment the patient was in terminal state of her disease requiring an intensive care. She had multiplex metastases in liver, in lymph nodes and in pleura. After the treatment with Erlotinib and immunomodulators for seven months a nearly complete remission (CR) was established in CT and her quality of life has been excellent.
Conclusion: This case report may support a hypothesis that EGFR inhibitors and type-1 immune cells activating immunomodulators together can synergistic inhibit the tumor growth. Further clinical investigations are necessary to clarify this question.

AB  - Background: In the last decades a special attention has been focused on the role of disturbed immune balance in the behavioral co-morbidities of tumor patients. The prognostic significance of malignant tumor-induced imbalance in the innate immune system is well known. The innate system uses a limited number of Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRR) to recognize conserved Pathogenic Associated Molecular Pattern (PAMP) structures expressed by microbes but not by host. Growing experiences suggest that the improvement of tumor induced disturbance of immune balance by using standardized plant PAMP like preparations goes often together with a better quality of life (QoL). Methods: In this study tumor patients were treated with standardized plant immunomodulators (mistletoe lectin and arabinoxylan) which were shown to activate the type-1 natural immune cells against cancer. After at least a therapy for six months the patients were asked about their QoL using questionnaires. Results: The following answers were received from the 35 patients: Decrease of pains: 17%, improvement of anxiety: 40%, Increase of physical activity: 71%, Improvement of appetite: 66%, Improvement of sleep: 40%, improvement of digestion: 43%, decrease of side effects during oncotherapy: 71%, beneficial judgement of the progress of disease based on clinical findings: 46%. As shown, the most important effects were the improvement of physical activity and decrease of side effects during conventional oncotherapy. Conclusion: Present results may support the relationship between tumor induced disturbance of immune balance and the tumor induced behavioral co-morbidities. Further clinical investigations are necessary to proof this hypothesis.

AB  - Abstract: Background: Metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma often has a multifocal tumor pattern with markedly depressed hepatic function. Hepatic resection in many cases results in no long-term benefit. After a chemotherapy hepatic tumors rarely disappear completely and the duration of responses is short. In the last decades growing evidence suggested that a disturbed balance in the innate system can also play a role in the poor prognosis of hepatic tumors.
Objectives: The aim of this article is to present and discuss several favorable clinical responses of patients with hepatic metastases who parallel to conventional oncologic therapy, were treated with immunologically effective and standardized plant extracts.
Course of Therapy and Results: R In accordance with the bell-shaped dose-response relationship of mistletoe lectins
(MLs), the patients were treated with a fermented mistletoe extract (ME) preparation, standardized for the active sugarbinding lectin contents. Thus, an optimal dose between 0.5 and 1.0ng/kg MLs was given twice a week subcutaneously. In addition to ML therapy, a heteropolysaccharide rice bran preparation standardized for arabinoxylan (12-45mg/kg MGN-3/Biobran 80mg/kg Avemar twice a week) and wheat germ extract (WGE) standardized for 2, 6-dimethoxy-p-benzoquinone (50four times a week) was also given. In these case reports the clinical progress of seven patients
R showed a complete or nearly complete remission of hepatic metastases.
Conclusion: ML, MGN-3 and WGE seem to be potent candidates to be regarded as a supportive therapy to surgery, hormone treatment or chemotherapy for patients with hepatic metastases. These case reports require further clinical studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of hydrolyzed rice bran (HRB), an arabinoxylan extracted from rice bran, on mast cell degranulation and cytokine production. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HRB was obtained by treating rice bran with an extract obtained from shiitake mushrooms. Bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) were prepared by culturing bone marrow cells from BALB/c mice in the presence of interleukin-3 and stem cell factor for 4 weeks. BMMCs were pretreated with HRB (0-3 mg/ml) for 30 min and were then antigen activated. RESULTS: Pretreatment of BMMCs with HRB significantly inhibited antigen-induced degranulation and cytokine production (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-4) in a dose-dependent manner. HRB also diminished membrane fusion between liposomes in which soluble N-ethyl maleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors were reconstituted. Phosphorylation of RelA and mitogen-activated kinases after antigen stimulation was suppressed by pretreatment of BMMCs with HRB. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that HRB may have an anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting mast cell degranulation and cytokine production.

AB  - The functional food, rice bran arabynoxylan derivative (BioBran), was administered for a long period to patients with chronic rheumatism given mainly symptomatic treatments with steroids, to evaluate its supplementary effect with representative treatments for rheumatism, such as steroids, analgesics, and thermotherapy. Steroids are essential for treatment of rheumatism, but it is desirable to minimize the dose, because they may cause adverse reactions. In recent years, there have been many reports on the functions of food ingredients, including superoxide scavenging and biophylaxis improving actions. This study evaluated the efficacy of BioBran, a functional food material. BioBran has been reported to have the effects of activationg natural killer cells (NK cells) and inhibiting inflammation. The author confirmed and reported that it relieved cold sympthoms in the elderly. The present study, where 8 patients with chronic rheumatism were given BioBran for 6 to 12 months, demonstrated the improvements of symptoms and QOL, suggesting its effectiveness.

AB  - We aimed to evaluate the radioprotective effect of hydrolyzed rice bran (HRB) on acute gastroenteritis due to chemoradiotherapy for treatment of cervical cancer. This placebo-controlled, double-blind study was conducted as an exploratory investigation of the colitis-inhibiting effects ofHRB in alleviating acute-phase gastrointestinal side effects ofchemoradiotherapy. The study involved 20 patients (10 in the HRB group, 10 in the control group). The patients in the control group underwent the same chemoradiotherapy regimen as those in the HRB group, but they received a placebo instead of HRB. The diarrheal side effect assessment score was lowerinthe HRBthancontrol group, andatrendtowardareductionindiarrheasymptomswas observed with theoralintakeof HRB. Additionally, no significant difference was observed in the administration of intestinal regulators and antidiarrheal agents, but again the assessment score was lower in the HRB than control group, and diarrhea symptoms were alleviated with the oral intake of HRB. A trend toward no need for strong antidiarrheal agents was seen. Although this study was an exploratory clinical trial, the results suggest that HRB may relieve diarrhea, an acute-phase gastrointestinal side effect of chemoradiotherapy.

AB  - MGN-3 (BioBran®) is derived from rice bran and is produced by the partial hydrolysis of the water soluble hemicellulose fraction ofrice bran by carbohydrases derived from Lentius edodes mycelia. It is a biological response modifier producing an increase in natural killer cell activity in immunocompromised patient. The aim ofthe study was to evaluate orally administered MGN-3 against gross pathological changes and weight loss produced by a single intraperitoneal dose of cisplatin or doxorubicin by daily oral dosing of 5 or 50 mg/kg MGN-3. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received either vehicle or MGN-3 prior to and after a single dose of cis-platinum or doxorubicin. Rats were observed for clinical signs daily for 11 days and body weights were recorded every other day. All animals were euthanized and necropsied on Day 11. Lethality was observed only in rats receiving cisplatin (50% with cisplatin alone reduced to 10% in rats receiving MGN-3 5 mg/kg, and 40% after MGN-3 50 mg/kg). Rats receiving MGN-3 at 5 or 50 mg plus cis-platinum or doxorubicin had a statistically significant greater weight gain than that observed with the chemotherapeutic agent alone. Rats receiving MGN-3 appeared healthier; gained weight and had a lower incidence ofdiarrhea and gross intestinal pathology. MGN-3 was effective at maintaining body weight after a toxic dose ofeither chemotherapeutic agent and protected against gross gastrointestinal pathological changes and diarrhea. MGN-3 may have potential for improving quality of life of patients receiving chemotherapy.

AB  - [Purpose] To investigate the effects of enzymatically modified rice-bran foods on preventing asthma and alleviating symptoms using TDI-induced asthmatic model mice.[Method] 2g/L Biobran (BB: Daiwa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) was dissolved in drinking water, and the above model mice (BALB/c, ♀) were divided into 4 groups, a to d, and administered daily. a: 1 month prior administration and TDI sensitization period and induction period, b: 1 month prior administration and until the end of the TDI sensitization period, c: TDI-induced period only, d: non-administration group. Group b is for prophylaxis, and group c is for symptom reduction. The effect of BB was evaluated by blood histamine concentration, eosinophils in BALF, TDI ear second application test, blood IgG1, IgG2a, and IgE type-specific antibody titers at the time of induction.[Results] Seven minutes after TD induction, the peak blood histamine concentration was 2.5 ± 0.53 (ng/ml) in group a, 4.2 ± 0.75 in group b, 4.3 ± 0.78 in group c, and 6.4 ± 0.87 (ng/ml) in group d. The BB-administered groups showed significantly lower values than the non-administered group. In provocation tests with TDI at various concentrations (0.01-10%), a 10- to 100-fold decrease in sensitivity was observed in the BB-treated groups compared to the non-administered group. The BB-administered groups also showed significantly lower eosinophil counts in BALF and TDI application tests.[Conclusion] Administration of BB showed a clear preventive and alleviation effect on asthma in TDI-induced asthma model mice. The action of BB does not affect Th2-induced production of IgG1 and IgE type antibodies, and rather it is suggested that it is a suppressor of mast cells.

AB  - Background. Recently, it was revealed that low grade mucosal inflammation and/or immune imbalance of the lower digestive tract is one of the mechanisms involved in symptom generation in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Biobran, arabinoxylan compound derived from rice bran, has been reported to have several biological actions such as anti-inflammatory and immune modulatory effects. So we investigated the therapeutic effects of Biobran in patients with IBS. Method. Forty patients with diarrhea predominant or mixed type IBS were randomly assigned to either a Biobran group for treatment with Biobran or a placebo group. Therapeutic efficacy and IBS symptoms were assessed subjectively by the patients after 4 weeks of administration. Results. The global assessment was effective in 63.2% of the Biobran group and in 30% of the placebo group (P<0.05, Biobran group versus placebo group). Biobran group showed a significant decrease in the score of diarrhea and constipation and in CRP value. However, no significant changes were observed in the placebo group. Conclusion. The administration of Biobran improved IBS symptoms. It is likely that anti-inflammatory and/or immune modulatory effects of Biobran might be useful in IBS patients.

AB  - Rice bran, a by-product of the rice dehulling process, contains bioactive polysaccharides which have immunomodulatory activity. We prepared fermented rice bran with Lentinus edodes mycelia [Erom’s fermented rice bran (EFR)] to extract the polysaccharides and improve the immune-enhancing properties. The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vitro and ex vivo immunostimulatory effects of EFR on mouse macrophages and splenocytes. We investigated the effects of EFR on the production of nitric oxide (NO) and cytokines using the Griess assay and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), while the expression of inducible nitric oxide (iNOS) and cytokines in RAW264.7 cells was measured using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Additionally, peritoneal macrophages and splenocytes were isolated from C57/BL6 mice. The macrophage lysosomal enzyme activity and splenocyte proliferation were determined using a lysosomal acid phosphatase assay and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)- 5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay, respectively. In vitro studies showed that EFR significantly increased the production of NO and cytokines [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-α], and up-regulated the mRNA expression of iNOS and cytokines in RAW264.7 cells. Ex vivo studies revealed that EFR increased splenocyte proliferation and lysosomal enzyme activity of peritoneal macrophages. These findings indicate that EFR could enhance immunity by inducing macrophage activation and splenocyte proliferation. Therefore, EFR has potential as a source material for functional foods that boost the immune system.

AB  - A 64-year-old female patient with umbilical metastasis of recurrent colorectal cancer (SMJN) was subjected to complementary medicine using the rice bran arabinoxylan derivative, a food component of BRM activity in addition to chemotherapy in order to maintain the QOL and prolong life. Although the umbilical metastasis is tending to grow, the patient is in a good nutritional condition and has survived for more than two years from diagnosis. SMJN is a distant metastasis, and even if it is the first occurrence, radical treatment may not be possible in most cases. This case suggests tha the maintenance of the QOL and physiological function may lead to a prolongation of life even in patients with terminal cancer with extremely poor prognosis like this. And this case presents the benefit of supplementary therapy using functional foods.

AB  - Biobran (MGN3, an Arabinoxylan compound), is a glyco-protein derived from rice bran and is produced by the partial hydrolysis of the water-soluble hemi cellulose fraction of rice bran by carbohydrases derived from lentius edodes mycelia. This preparation has been shown to enhance human natural killer cell activity.

Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterised by deficiency of natural killer cell activity. We therefore decided to try the use of Biobran on 10 patients with chronic fatigue syndrome for a 2-month period, assessing their progress by the use of a visual analogue scale, and a Likert scale of fatigue. We also used the Chalder fatigue scale.

This study shows that Biobran is effective in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome who have a clear viral etiology. It does not appear to benefit patients with alternative causations of chronic fatigue syndrome. It would be wise to measure natural killer cell activity of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome before commencing Biobran treatment, and to reserve treatment only for those patients with depressed natural killer cell activity. This paper would support such an approach.

AB  - Rice bran is by-product from the dehulling process of rice, an important staple food in Korea. Various studies have been reported immune-enhancing effects of rice bran cultured with Lentinus edodes. In particular black rice bran that contains anthocyanin has the beneficial effects on immune system. SuperC3GHi, a recently released black colored rice cultivar, has higher contents of cyanidine-3-glucoside (C3G), a strong antioxidant than those of currently cultivated black rice cultivars. In this study, we investigate the beneficial effects of fermented SuperC3GHi rice bran (C3G-F) with Lentinus edodes. Using in vivo and in vitro model for inflammation and allgergy, anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic effects of C3G-F were determined. C3G-F induced tumor suppressive effect on Sarcoma-180 cell and B16 melanoma cell injected to mice. These results suggest that the capacity of C3G-F seems to act as a potent immunomodulator and with the absence of notable sideeffects,C3G-F could be used as a novel functional food ingredient having possible therapeutic effects against immunological disorders.

AB  - Rice bran is byproducts of the hulling of rice, an important food resource in Korea. Various studies have been reported immune-enhancing effects of rice bran cultured with Lentinus edodes. In particular black rice bran contains anthocyanin, and the effects of antioxidant have been reported. The objective of the this study was to investigate the possible immune enhancing effects of black rice bran substance extracted from a submerged culture of Lentinus edodes with black rice bran (crude fermentation-polysaccharide, CFP) and products(crude fermentation-polysaccharide-S. cerevisiae CFP-S, crude fermentation polysaccharide-L. gasseri, CFP-L) which are of secondary fermentation of by using Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Lactobacillus gasseri in the Blab/c male mice. We found that supplementation of CFP, CFP-S and CFP-L enhanced macrophage and splenocyte proliferation compared to the control group(NC) in mice. Also, we measured the concentration of cytokines(IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-6) secreted by activated macrophage and splenocyte. The results of the experiment are that supplementation of CFP and CFP-S increased the macrophage and splenocyte proliferation compared to the control group but supplementation of CFP-L decreased the splenoyte proliferation compared to the control group(without mitogen and treated with LPS). When macrophage and splenocyte were stimulated by CFP and CFP-S supplementation, it was increased IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-6 concentration compared with the control group. These results suggest that the capacity of CFP and CFP-S seem to act as a potent immune modulator causing augmentation of immune cell activity, and enhance the immue function through regulating cytokine production capacity by activated macrophage and splenocyte in mice.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to determine the possible immune-enhancing effects of a substance extracted from a submerged culture of Lentinus edodes with rice bran (SLRB). According to the results obtained by measuring the in vitro macrophage activity of the exo-biopolymer from SLRB, it appears to exhibit activity similar to that of LPS, and this activity seems to occur in a dose-dependent manner. According to the results obtained by measuring splenocyte proliferation, the exo-biopolymer appears to induce an increase in proliferation of approximately 1.4-fold compared to the control group. We measured the proliferation of bone marrow cells in order to evaluate gut immunity and, according to our results, proliferation was increased to 109% that of the control group, and was similar to that associated with LPS. In order to characterize the enhancement of immunological activity in vivo, we orally administered the exo-biopolymer (25, 50, 250 mg/kg bw) to C3H/He mice, and then measured the macrophage activity, determining that the activity was higher than that of the controls at concentrations of 50 and 250 mg/kg. Therefore, the exo-biopolymer from SLRB can be considered to be a useful a BRM agent, as it clearly allows some protection against immunological diseases.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the activation of natural killer (NK) cells and anticancer effects of exo-biopolymer from rice bran cultured with Lentinus edodes [rice bran exo-biopolymer (RBEP)]. Oral administration of RBEP induced the activation of NK cells in a dose-dependent manner. RBEP also prolonged the life spans of mice transplanted with Sarcoma-180 cells and inhibited growing Sarcoma-180 cells in intraperitoneum. Solid tumor growth was also suppressed by oral administration of RBEP in C57/Bl6 mice transplanted with B16/Bl6 melanoma. Intraperitoneal injection of RBEP was more effective than oral administration at the same dosage in mice with transplanted tumor cells. According to this result, when RBEP directly contacts immune cells, the anticancer activity is higher than by indirectly inducing an immune response through oral administration. Therefore, we suggest that the administration of RBEP may be effective for preventing and/or treating cancer through NK cell activation. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the possible mechanisms of the anticancer activity and to investigate the other beneficial effects of RBEP for the development of a new biological response modifier.

AB  - A rapid increase in cancer incidence accompanied by aging population requires evidence-based supportive cancer care practices. Cancer therapies often accompany adverse events which induce malnutrition and declined quality of life. We conducted an 8-week non-randomized clinical trial to evaluate efficacy of cereal-based oral nutritional supplement (ONS) intervention on nutritional status, quality of life and inflammatory responses in cancer patients undergoing cancer therapy with 5% < weight loss. The study included 34 pateints (24 in control group, 10 in intervention group) with 15 drop-outs. ONS used in this intervention contained 0.5% arabinoxylan-rich fermented rice bran powder and 5.5% black rice powder as active ingredients in a regular cereal-based formula. Results showed that ONS intervention for 8 weeks did not show significant improvement in blood biomarkers of nutritional status or patient-generated subjective global assessment scores. However, 8-week of intervention showed reduced interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β secretion in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells while IL-12p70 level was increased. For health-related quality of life (HRQoL) indices, emotional functioning and fatigue symptoms were improved after 4 weeks only in the intervention group although no difference was found at week 8. These results suggest that ONS intervention may improve chronic inflammatory status and HRQoL indices (at week 4) in cancer patients receiving treatments.

AB  - Background: Human infection by pathogenic Salmonella bacteria can be acquired by consuming of undercooked meat products and eggs. Antimicrobial resistance against antibiotics used in medicine is also a major concern. To help overcome these harmful effects on microbial food safety and human health, we are developing novel antimicrobial food-compatible formulations, one of which is described in the present study.

Methods: The composition of a bioprocessed (fermented) rice bran extract (BPRBE) from Lentinus edodes liquid mycelia culture was evaluated using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, and the mechanism of its antibacterial effect against Salmonella Typhimurium, strain SL1344 was investigated in macrophage cells and in mice.

Results: BPRBE stimulated uptake of the bacteria into RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cells. Activation of the cells was confirmed by increases in NO production resulting from the elevation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA, and in protein expression. Salmonella infection down-regulated the expression of the following protein biomarkers of autophagy (a catabolic process for stress adaptation of cellular components): Beclin-1, Atg5, Atg12, Atg16, LC3-I and LC3-II. BPRBE promoted the upregulation of protein expressions that induced bacterial destruction in autolysosomes of RAW 264.7 cells. ELISA analysis of interferon IFN-β showed that inflammatory cytokine secretion and bactericidal activity had similar profiles, suggesting that BPRBE enhances cell-autonomous and systemic bactericidal activities via autophagic capture of Salmonella. The treatment also elicited increased excretion of bacteria in feces and their decreased translocation to internal organs (cecum, mesenteric lymph node, spleen, and liver).

Conclusions: The antibiotic mechanism of BPRBE involves the phagocytosis of extracellular bacteria, autophagic capture of intracellular bacteria, and prevention of translocation of bacteria across the intestinal epithelial cells. The new bioprocessing combination of mushroom mycelia and rice brans forms a potentially novel food formulation with in vivo antimicrobial properties that could serve as a functional antimicrobial food and medical antibiotic.

AB  - Endotoxemia (sepsis, septic shock) is an inflammatory, virulent disease that results mainly from bacterial infection. The present study investigates the inhibitory effect of a bioprocessed polysaccharide (BPP) isolated from the edible Lentinus edodes liquid mycelial mushroom culture supplemented with black rice bran against murine endotoxemia induced by the Salmonella lipopolysaccharide and d-galactosamine (LPS/GalN). BPP was obtained after dialysis against water using a cellulose tube with a molecular weight cutoff of 10000. BPP eluted as a single peak on an HPLC chromatogram. Acid hydrolysis of BPP showed the presence of the following sugars: fucose, galactose, galactosamine, glucose, glucosamine, mannose, rhamnose, and xylose. Treatment of BPP with β-glucanase reduced its immunostimulating activity, suggesting that the polysaccharide has a β-glucan structure. Pretreatment of mice with BPP via oral or intraperitoneal (ip) administration for 2 weeks resulted in the suppression of LPS/GalN-induced catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and transaminase (GOT/GPT) liver enzymes, amelioration of necrotic liver lesions, and reduction of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and nitrite serum levels as well as myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, an index of necrotic injury. Immunostimulating macrophage activity was up to 5.4-fold greater than that observed with the culture without the rice bran. BPP also extended the lifespan of the toxemic mice. These positive results with inflammation biomarkers and lifespan studies suggest that the BPP can protect mice against LPS/GalN-induced liver, lung, and kidney injuries and inflammation by blocking oxidative stress and TNF-α production, thus increasing the survival of the toxic shock-induced mice. The polysaccharide has the potential to serve as a new functional food.

AB  - The present study investigated the antibacterial effect of a bioprocessed polysaccharide (BPP) isolated from Lentinus edodes liquid mycelial culture supplemented with black rice bran against murine salmonellosis. BPP was not bactericidal in vitro, it did, however, stimulate uptake of the bacteria into RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cells, as indicated by increased colony-forming unit (CFU) counts of the contents of the lysed macrophages incubated with Salmonella Typhimurium for 30 and 60 min. Two hours postinfection, the bacterial counts drastically increased in the macrophages, but 4 and 8 h postinfection BPP extract-treated cells showed lower bacterial counts than the vehicle (saline phosphate pH 7.4 buffer, PBS)-treated control. BPP elicited altered morphology and markedly elevated inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase (iNOS) mRNA and protein expression in the infected macrophage cells. BPP also activated leukocytes in S. Typhimurium-infected mice, as determined by spleen lymphocyte proliferation and IFN-γ levels in mice sera. ELISA analysis on cytokine production by Th1 and Th2 immune cells from splenocytes of infected mice showed significant increases in the levels of the following Th1 cytokines: IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-12. Histology assays of the livers of mice infected with a sublethal dose (1 × 10(4) CFU) of S. Typhimurium showed that BPP, administered daily through an intraperitoneal (ip) or oral route, protected against necrosis of the liver, a biomarker of in vivo salmonellosis. The lifespan of mice similarly infected with a lethal dose of S. Typhimurium (1 × 10(5) CFU) was significantly extended by ip injection or oral administration of the BPP without side effects. These results suggest that the activity of BPP against bacterial infection in mice occurs mainly through the activation of macrophage-mediated immune response resulting from augmented Th1 immunity. The significance of the results for microbial food safety and human health and further research needs are discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Given the ongoing problems of hypertension and endothelial dysfunction in the HIV population, the primary objective of the study was to assess the cardiovascular, endothelial function, and immune markers in response to rice bran arabinoxylan compound (RBAC) treatment in a sample of HIV(+) adults on antiretroviral therapy (ART). STUDY DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of 6 months was used to execute the study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-seven subjects were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of two study conditions (n=22 RBAC and n=25 placebo) for 6 months with assessments at baseline and 3 and 6 months. A multivariate repeated measures analysis of variance model was used to assess the differences between RBAC and placebo groups in cardiovascular (systolic blood pressure), endothelial function (skin blood flow in response to nitric oxide), and immune (CD4(+) cell count) markers from baseline to 6 months. RESULTS: The effect of treatment (RBAC versus placebo) was significant (Wilks' λ=0.92, F[3, 102]=3.07, P=0.03). The effect of time was significant (Wilks' λ=0.10, F[2, 103]=474.6, P<0.001). The overall interaction between treatment and time was significant (Wilks' λ=0.92, F[2, 103]=4.58, P=0.01). Time contrasts showed that a difference in the overall dependent variable did not occur from baseline to 3 months (F[1, 104]=2.7, P=0.10), marginally occurred from baseline to 6 months (F[1, 104]=3.2, P=0.08), and was significant from 3 to 6 months (F[1, 104]=6.43, P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The overall significant interaction suggests varying responses in the dependent variables between RBAC and placebo over time, which is being driven by systolic blood pressure, as it decreased in the RBAC group, but increased in the placebo group. In addition, CD4(+) manifested a non-significant increase from baseline to 3 months then decreased from 3 to 6 months in the RBAC group, whereas it decreased at 3 months followed by a slight increase at 6 months in the placebo group. Skin blood flow in response to nitric oxide improved non-significantly overall in both groups, but worsened from 3 to 6 months in the placebo group. Thus, RBAC treatment may contribute to modest short-term improvements in systolic blood pressure, endothelial function, and CD4(+) cell count, which could help improve the overall health profile of HIV(+) adults. RELEVANCE FOR PATIENTS: Persons with HIV on ART suffer disproportionately from hypertension and endothelial dysfunction compared to the non-infected population, and conventional medical therapy does not alleviate these issues. RBAC is a safe, low-risk alternative that may help to improve the overall quality of life of these patients through modest improvements in these biomarkers plus CD4(+) cell count.

AB  - The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effects of a hydrolyzed polysaccharide, rice bran arabinoxylan compound (RBAC), on immune, hepatic, and renal function in HIV + individuals. A 6-month randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial was utilized to conduct the intervention. Forty-seven HIV + individuals on stable antiretroviral therapy were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of the 2 study conditions (n = 22 RBAC and n = 25 placebo) and consumed 3 gram/day of either compound for 6 months. Participants were assessed at baseline and 3 and 6 months follow-up for CD4+ and CD8+, liver enzymes, and kidney function. No side effects were reported, and liver and kidney markers remained nearly completely within normal limits. The percentage change in CD4+ was similar for the placebo (+2.2%) and RBAC (+3.1%) groups at 6 months follow-up. The percentage change in CD8+ count significantly decreased from baseline to 6 months in the RBAC group (−5.2%), whereas it increased in the placebo group (+57.8%; p = 0.04). The CD4+/CD8+ ratio improved clinically in the RBAC group from 0.95 (SD = 0.62) at baseline to 1.07 (SD = 0.11) at 6 months, whereas it declined in the placebo group from 0.96 (SD = 0.80) at baseline to 0.72 (SD = 0.59) at 6 months. Our results showed a statistically significant decrease in CD8+ count and a clinically significant increase in CD4+/CD8+ ratio for the RBAC group compared to the placebo group. Thus, the results of this study suggest that the immunomodulatory and antisenescent activities of RBAC are promising for the HIV population.

AB  - The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of a hydrolyzed polysaccharide, Rice Bran Arabinoxylan Compound (RBAC), on biomarkers in adults with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A 90-day randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial examined the effect of RBAC on complete blood count, liver enzymes, lipids, oxidative stress markers, cytokines, and growth factors. Twenty-three adults with NAFLD were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of the two study conditions (n = 12 RBAC and n = 11 placebo) and consumed 1 gram/day of either compound for 90 days. Subjects were assessed at baseline and 45 and 90 days. No adverse effects were reported. Alkaline phosphatase significantly decreased (−3.1%; SD = 19.9; F[1, 19] = 5.1, p=0.03) in the RBAC group compared to placebo. Percent monocytes (17.9%; SD = 18.3; F[1, 19] = 5.9, p=0.02) and percent eosinophils (30.6%; SD = 30.5; F[1, 19] = 12.3, p<0.01) increased in the RBAC group. IFN-γ (156%; SD = 131.8; F[1, 19] = 4.2, p=0.06) and IL-18 (29.1%; SD = 64; F[1, 19] = 5.3, p=0.03) increased in the RBAC group compared to placebo. Other improvements were noted for platelets, neutrophils, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, γ-glutamyl transferase, and 4-hydroxynonenal. RBAC had beneficial effects on several biomarkers that add to the known immunomodulatory activities of RBAC, which may be promising for people with NAFLD. This trial is registered with NCT02568787.

AB  - In the last years, several immunomodulating antitumor agents have demonstrated in the nature, particularly from Aloe plant and rice bran. However, the major problem concerning the natural antitumor agents is to define their immune mechanisms of action in relation to the more recent advances in tumor immunobiology.At present, the main cause responsible for the lack of an effective antitumor response in advanced cancer patients is belived to be represented by the generation of a subtype of T helper lymphocytes (CD4) with suppressive activity on anticancer immunity, the so-called T regulatory lymphocytes (T reg), which may be clinically identified as CD4*CD25* cells.On this basis, a study was planned to evaluate the effect of rice bran extract arabinoxylan on T reg cell count and percentage in solid tumor patients in relation to the various lymphocyte subpopulations. The study included 22 evaluable cancer patients, 16 of whom had an untreatable metastatic solid tumor. Arabinoxylan was given orally at a dose of 2000 mg/day for the first month, followed by a dose of 1000 mg/day for the next month. In each patient we evaluated by monoclonal antibodies the absolute number of lymphocytes, T lymphocytes (CD3*), T helper (TH) lymphocytes (CD4*), T cytotoxic lymphocytes (CD8*), NK cells (CD16*CD56*), T reg lymphocytes (CD4*CD25*) and TH/T reg ratio before and after 2 months of therapy. No substantial change occurred on therapy in the mean number of lymphocytes, CD3*, CD8* and NK cells. On the other hand, the mean number of TH cells increased, whereas that of T reg cell decreased on treatment, even though none of these differences was statistically significant. On the contrary, TH/T reg mean ratio significantly enhanced after arabinoxylan therapy. In addition to its previously demonstrated stimulatory action on NK function, this study shows that arabinoxylan may inhibit the production of T reg cells, which are responsible for cancer-related immunosuppression, with a following improvement in the anticancer immunity.If further studies will confirm these results, arabinoxylan could be successfully associated with chemotherapy to induce not only a cytotoxic destruction of cancer cells, but also an improvement in the immune status.

AB  - This case report describes an uncommon tumor treated with an unproven medication found by the patient during an Internet search. MGN-3 is an arabinoxylane derived from rice bran that has been enzymatically modified by an extract of the mushroom Hypbomycetes mycelicz. ln vivo murine studies have reported increased natural killer cell activity with MGN-3 supplementation. An in vitro investigation revealed increased tumor necrosis factor or and interferon-y production by peripheral blood lymphocytes treated with MGN-3. In addition, MGN-3 was found to enhance anti-CD95 antibody-induced apoptosis in a human leukemic cell line. This biologic response modifier has been studied in a limited number of patients With human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease or cancer, with improvement in natural killer cell function and disease activity over time. Further studies are needed, however, to ascertain the therapeutic benefits of this relatively novel compound.

AB  - Objective: The aim of study was to assess the effect of Biobran in reducing of chemotherapy induced side effects in terms of tiredness, anorexia, vomiting and hair loss and quality of life in terms of weight loss.Setting: Radiotherapy Department, Nishtar Hospital  Multan.Material and Methods: Fifty patients of breast cancer were enrolled randomly in two groups. Group—A patients were given 3 gram dose of Biobran MGN-3 per day one week before and one week after chemotherapy. Group-B patient were given chemotherapy alone. Total six cycles of chemotherapy were given. No multivitamin orfood supplements were given during this study.Chemotherapy induced side effects (tiredness, anorexia, and vomiting, hair loss) were assessed by questionnaire to the patients before start of each cycle. Weight was checked before each cycle to assess weight gain or loss. White blood cells were checked by complete blood count just before and one week after chemotherapy.Results: Between six months, 50 patients were enrolled in Radiotherapy Department, Nishtar Hospital Multan. There was asignificant reduction in tiredness and anorexia in group—A patients. 20 (80%) patients of group-A felt increase intheirdiet and notiredness without any appetizeror multivitamin. But group—B patients demanded for appetizer due to severe anorexia after chemotherapy except 3 (12%) patients who didn‘t use any appetizer or food supplement. In group-A, 15 (60%) patients didnt need any anti-emetic as compared to group-B all patient (100%) experienced severe nausea during and after chemotherapy. Group—A patients experienced less hairfall 7 (28%) patients as compared to other group which is 25 (100%) patients.Conclusions: The study showed that, by helping to optimize the immune system, Biobran MGN-3 can not only help maximize treatment success, but also minimize treatment side effects and improve quality of life during treatment and in recovery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous research has suggested that natural killer (NK) cell activity may be reduced in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of a putative NK cell stimulant, BioBran MGN-3, in reducing fatigue in CFS patients. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: We recruited 71 patients with CFS (according to the Centers for Disease Control 1994 criteria) attending an out-patient specialist CFS service. Participants were given oral BioBran MGN-3 for 8 weeks (2 g three times per day) or placebo equivalent. The primary outcome measure was the Chalder physical fatigue score. Self-reported fatigue measures, self-assessment of improvement, change in key symptoms, quality of life, anxiety and depression measures were also included. RESULTS: Data were complete in 64/71 patients. Both groups showed marked improvement over the study duration, but without significant differences. Mean improvement in the Chalder fatigue score (physical scale) was 0.3 (95%CI -2.6 to 3.2) lower in the BioBran group. DISCUSSION: The findings do not support a specific therapeutic effect for BioBran in CFS. The improvement showed by both groups over time highlights the importance of placebo controls when evaluating interventions in CFS.

AB  - BioBran/MGN-3 derived from rice bran is known to have various physiological functions including NK cell and macrophage activation and its immunomodulatory function is attracting uttention. ln addition, BioBran/MGN-3 has been reportcd to have antitumor activity and its clinical application as an antitumor agent is anticipated. Application of BioBran/MGN-3 requires analyses of the mechamsns of various physiological actions and the active ingredients. Although many studies on BioBran/MGN-3 have been reported, there are few detailed studies on the active component of BioBran/MGN-3 and tn immunomodulatory ingredient is unknown. This study analyzed the component of BioBran/MGN-3 involved in immunomodulatory activity usns macrophage stimulation as the indicator as well as the chemical structure of the active ingredient.

AB  - We have recently examined the oncolytic effect of arabinoxylan rice bran. MGN-3/biobran. against solid Ehrlich carcinoma (SEC)-bearing mice via immune-modulation and apoptosis [N.K. Badr El-din. E. Noaman, M. Ghoneum, In vivo tumor inhibitory effects of nutritional rice bran supplement MGN-3/biobran on Ehrlich carcinoma-bearing mice, Nutr. Cancer 60 (2) (2008) 235-244]. In the present study, we examined the antioxidant system as another possible mechanism through which MGN-3 exerts its oncostatic potential. Female albino mice were inoculated intramuscularly in the right thigh with Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cells. MGN-3 (25 mg/kg body weight) was injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) six times a week for 25 days into mice at either day 4 or day 11 post-EAC cell inoculation. Tumor growth, lipid peroxidation (LPx), glutathione (GSH) contents, the activity of the antioxidant scavenger enzymes, and alterations in gene expression were examined. MGN-3 efficiently suppressed the growth of tumors, which was associated with normalization of the LPx levels and augmentation of GSH contents. MGN-3 enhanced the activity of the endogenous antioxidant scavenging enzymes - superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) - in blood. liver, and tumor tissue. Similarly it up-regulated the expression of GPx, SOD1 and CAT rnRNA in the liver. The effect of MGN-3 was more pronounced when treated early, at day 4 of tumor cell inoculation, as compared to later treatment at 11 days. In Conclusion, MGN-3-induced oncostatic activity by modulating lipid peroxidation, augmenting the antioxidant defense system and protecting against oxidative stress. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - The effect of modified rice bran (MGN-3) on glucose tolerance as studied in NIDDM adult rats and changes in taste preference were also examined. NIDDM adult rats were made by intraperitoneal injection of 100mg streptozotocin at 1.5 days of age. Following weaning, the animals were divided into 3 groups, control, diabetic rats fed 1% cellulose diet and diabetic rats fed 1% MGN-3 diet. Rats were free access to experimental diets and water for 2 months. Oral glucose tolerance tests were performed at 8 weeks of age. Two-bottle-choice preference tests between aqueous solution, either of 5mM citric acid, 0.016mM quinine sulfate, 0.82mM sodium saccharin, 21mM sodium chiloride or 27 mM monosodium glutamate, and deionized water were conducted in the experimental period. Trunk blood were collected and plasma levels of insulin, glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, Total protein, albumin, urea nitorogen and zinc were measured. Plasma glucose levels increased significantly faster and higher than that of the normal controls in oral glucose tolerance test. When the NIDDM rats administered MGN-3, the abrupt rise of plasma glucose levels slowed down. Although taste preferences in NIDDM rats were not significantly different as to the control, diabetic rats showed aversion to sourness as was observed in IDDM rats (Nutrition Research, in press). The plasma total cholesterol level only among various parameters lowered significantly by the administration of MGN-3. MGN-3 can be useful as a dietary fiber supplement for the treatment of diabetes.

AB  - The present study was designed to determine whether or not the administration of modified rice bran could improve streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. Taste preferences were also: compared in diabetic and control rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into control and diabetic groups. A single STZ injection, 65 mg per kg body mass i.p., induced diabetes. Rats were given free access to commercial diet and water for 2 months and modified rice bran (0.5 g per kg body mass) was administered daily by stomach tube. Two-bottle-choice preference tests between aqueous solutions of either 5 mM citric acid, 27 mM monosodium glutamate, 0.016 mM quinine, or 0.82 mM saccharin in deionized water were conducted in the experimental period. Blood was collected and serum levels of glucose, insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, urea nitrogen, total protein, albumin, and zinc were measured. Serum triglycerides and total cholesterol decreased with the administration of modified rice bran, although serum insulin and glucose remained low and high, respectively. Water intake was also reduced by the modified rice bran, which suggests that polyuria induced by STZ improved. Diabetic rats showed significant aversion to citric acid and quinine when compared with control rats. Modified rice bran can be useful as a dietary fiber supplement for the treatment of diabetes. In addition, high taste sensitivity for sourness and/or bitterness is a characteristic of STZ-induced diabetes. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - The clinical treatments for cancer were surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy with anticancer drugs. For surgery, even if the procedure used is highly sophisticated, cancer cells may be transported to other organs via the vascular or lymph system. For radiotherapy, although it destroys cancer tissues it may also damage the surrounding functioning tissues. Anticancer drugs may destroy cancer cells as well as normally functioning cells of other organs. Consequently, these drawbacks of the three types of treatments must be recognized when addressing cancer patients. This is where immunotherapy counts. The author has been working with immunotherapy for 25 years, and this time chose combination therapy with BioBran (rice bran arabinoxylan derivative), and BRP (Bio-Reproducing Protein) intravenously.Case 1.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rice bran arabinoxylan compound (RBAC) is a nutraceutical for enhancing a depleted immune system during and after cancer treatment. This pilot feasibility trial aims to evaluate the effects of RBAC on cancer patients' quality of life during active treatment, compared to placebo, using a validated questionnaire. Other outcome measures include changes in inflammatory and nutritional status, cytokine profile, and gut microbiota. METHODS/DESIGN: The study will recruit 50 participants from a regional cancer center in Australia. Patients aged 18-70, diagnosed with solid organ cancers stage II and above, and currently undergoing active systemic therapies, are eligible. Random allocation of participants into two groups is stratified based on metastatic status and treatment type. The dosage is either 3 g/day of RBAC or placebo in identical packaging. The participants, study coordinator, and treating oncologists are blinded to the interventions. Data collections are at baseline and at four follow-up sessions, which are six weeks apart (24 weeks). Statistical analysis will involve a protected p-value with multiple dependent values and analyzed by ANOVA with repeated measures on the occasion of testing and with both a full Bonferroni or Sidak corrections applied to protect against Type I errors. Any observed significance warrants further analysis with pairwise comparisons. Analysis of covariance will also be performed to assess any influence of the demographic data, cancer diagnosis, as well as changes in physical activity, dietary habits, and complementary medicine usage. Comparisons of gut microbiota will be based on the analysis of the fecal microbiome using 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid amplicon sequencing. The proposed research timeline is from October 2018 to May 2022.TRIAL REGISTRATIONANZCTR. Reg No: ACTRN12619000562178p.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Natural killer cell (NK) cytotoxic activity plays a major role in natural immunologic defences against malignancies. NK cells are emerging as a tool for adoptive cancer immunotherapies. Arabinoxylan rice bran (MGN-3/Biobran) has been described as a biological response modifier that can enhance the cytotoxic activity of NK cells. This study evaluated the effect of MGN-3/Biobran on NK cell activation, expansion and cytotoxicity against neuroblastoma cells. METHODS: NK cells were enriched with magnetic beads and stimulated with MGN-3/Biobran. NK cell activation was evaluated via analysis of their phenotype, and their expansion capability was tracked. The in vitro cytotoxic ability of the activated NK cells was tested against K562, Jurkat, A673, NB1691, A-204, RD and RH-30 cell lines and the in vivo cytotoxic ability against the NB1691 cell line. RESULTS: MGN-3/Biobran stimulation of NK cells induced a higher expression of the activation-associated receptors CD25 and CD69 than in unstimulated cells (P < 0.05). The expression of NKG2D, DNAM, NCRs and TLRs remained unchanged. Overnight MGN-3/Biobran stimulation increased NK cell cytotoxic activity against all cell lines tested in vitro and decelerated neuroblastoma growth in vivo. The mechanism is not mediated by lipopolysaccharide contamination in MGN-3/Biobran. Furthermore, the addition of MGN-3/Biobran promoted NK cell expansion and decreased T cells in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that MGN-3/Biobran upregulates NK cell activation markers, stimulates NK cell cytotoxic activity against neuroblastoma in vitro and in vivo and selectively augments the expansion of NK cells. These results may be useful for future NK cell therapeutic strategies of the treatment of neuroblastoma.

AB  - Context: Rice Bran Arabinoxylan Compound (RBAC) is a trusted and proven immunomodulator made from a rice bran extract that has been enzymatically modified with an enzyme complex from the shiitake mushroom. Objective: The study's primary objective was to identify the role of RBAC in supporting cancer therapies. Design: The author designed an open study. Participants: Participants were 14 patients who are suffering from various type of malignancies. Intervention:  BRM4 capsules-a commercially available, proprietary RBAC supplement-were administered. Outcome Measures: The study measured circulating tumor cells (CTC) and tumor markers-the prostatespecific antigen (PSA) and cancer antigens 125 (CA125) 15-3 (CA15-3), and 27-29 (CA27-29) for the relevant malignancy. Results: Twelve out of 14 participants completed the protocol, and two participants died during the study. Of the 12 participants completing the study, the CTC levels were reduced in 10, with a statistically significant difference between the testing at baseline and postintervention (P = .0047). The tumor markers of various malignancies decreased for nine out the 12 participants, and one participant experienced remission. Conclusions: The results suggest that the product can be an effective immunomodulator that can complement conventional cancer treatment. (Altern Ther Health Med. 2022;28(1):8-10).

AB  - Introduction: Although modern therapies for cancer have improved life expectancy, the management of disease and improvement of quality of life (QoL) of patients, especially managing cancer-related pain and chronic fatigue syndrome are still limited. We demonstrate the efficacy of a combined therapy to treat cancer patients suffering from CFS. The effects of a combined therapy in cancer patients suffering from CFS was evaluated. NK cells were stimulated, additional tumour treatment together with targeted radiofrequency therapy (Oncothermia).Methods: SIXTY patients with CFS (due to suffering from any type of cancer) were recruited, (according to the Centres for Disease Control 1994 criteria) attending an outpatient specialist CFS service for controlled pilot study. A total of 25 participants were given oral BioBran (MGN-3-Arabinoxylane), + Oncothermia, for six months, equivalent control group has not received this complex (BioBran + Oncothermia) treatment, they received chemo-, radiotherapy treatment.Results: The whole body pH status showed strong tissue acidity before the treatment, but the BioBran group changed the tissue pH status. The most important finding was that the average of CFQ score was significantly reduced after the treatment, and in control group the CFQ scores did not change significantly.Conclusion: The findings support a specific therapeutic effect of the complex BioBran+ Oncothermia therapy in CFS of cancer patients improving their QoL, enhancing NK activity in synergy.

AB  - Current treatments for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) have severe side effects and are very expensive. There is a need to explore effective natural therapies against HCV that are less toxic and more cost-effective. In the current study, 37 chronic HCV patients were randomized into two groups and treated with either pegylated interferon (PEG IFN) plus ribavirin (n = 21) or Biobran, an arabinoxylan from rice bran (1 g/day) (n = 16). We examined viremia, liver enzymes, interferon- gamma (IFN- gamma ) levels in serum, and toxicity before and three months after treatment. Both groups showed a significant and similar reduction in viral load after three months of treatment relative to the baseline viral load ( P <0.05). In addition, treatment with Biobran resulted in a significant increase in the level of IFN- gamma ( P <0.001). Patients in the PEG IFN plus ribavirin group showed fever, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and easy fatigue. Patients in the Biobran group showed no side effects and reported good health. We conclude that Biobran is a potential novel therapeutic regimen that has a similar effect to PEG IFN plus ribavirin and is safe and cost-effective in the treatment of chronic HCV. Our finding of Biobran's efficacy against HCV infection warrants further investigation in multiple clinical trials (Clinical Trials Registration: NCT02690103).

AB  - Arabinoxylan (hereafter called MGN-3) is a plant polysaccharide processed food with a biophylactic action, which mainly contains polysaccharides such as hemicellulose and arabinoxylan and glycoprotein. MGN-3 is known to have various biophylactic actions such as in vitro NK cell activity stimulation and anti-HIV effect. In the present study, the vital defense activating effect of MGN-3 was studied in 3 animal experiments: Experiment 1 examined its effect on the survival in a lipopolysaccharide-induced lethal sepsis model, Experiment 2 studied the anti-stress effect on restraint stress, and Experiment 3 examined its effect on the survival of autoimmune disease-prone (NZBxNZW) F1 mice.

AB  - The present study was designed to deremine whether or not the administration of MGN-3 coud have its apothanasia effect and improve the QOL for 205 progressive and partially metastasized cancer patients in late III-IV stages after surgery. MGN-3 is a rice bran arabinoxylan derivative and known to have immunomodulation activity. The participants in this clinical study are hospitalized patients in our clinic treated with complementary alternative medicines (we call it "Non-Conventional Therapy") and anticancer medicines with lesser side effects. The 205 patients hospitalized for 6 months were grouped into two groups, viz, 109 patients (control group) treated with our standard complementary alternative medicines, and 96 patients who were further given MGN-3 (MGN-3 group) for one year and a half. All the patients were measured for natural killer activity as an indication for the variation of immunoparameters. Simultaneously, the QOL of the patients was also checked. The NK cell activities of the patients after surgery were low on average; however, by the administration of MGN-3, NK activity was observed to increase and the apothanasia ratio aslo increased; the higher the patient NK activity is, the higher the apothanasia ratio was observed to rise. The above findings indicate that NK activity can be used as a pathological index of progressive cancers. QOL improvement was also observed with the adminstration of MGN-3.

AB  - Immunostimulants have been explored to reduce the complications of radiation/chemotherapy. This double blind randomized trial aimed to determine the immunomodulating effects of Lentin among head and neck cancer patients in addressing radiation treatment complications such as anemia, leukopenia, weight loss and improvement of quality of life. Sixty-five (65) patients were enrolled and given either Lentin or placebo - 2 weeks prior, during radiation/chemoradiotherapy and 2 months after. Complete Blood Count, Body Mass Index, percent weight loss and EORTC Quality of Life questionnaires QLQ H&N35 were used to assess the degree of anemia, weight loss and quality of life. Overall CBC results revealed higher values on all parameters in Lentin arm. Upon completion of radiochemotherapy, the Lentin arm showed significantly higher mean hemoglobin by 1.30 g/dL (p=0.010), hematocrit (p=0.001), RBC (p=0.001) and platelets (p=0.017). Also, higher overall BMI (22.69 versus 21.52) and a lower percent weight loss (6.10% versus 6.91%) for Lentin compared to placebo were noted with p-values of 0.199 and 0.571, respectively. Treatment related toxicity using the RTOG grading showed lower severity scores on all parameters (p-values: >0.05) and better QoL scores for patients taking Lentin (p-value: 0.019). Results from this study showed better clinical outcomes for patients taking Lentin. These have led to fewer blood transfusions, treatment delays and hospital admissions, avoidance of treatment mortalities and morbidities, and improved quality of life among head and neck cancer patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy.

AB  - The preventive effect of Hydrolyzed Rice Bran against the common cold syndrome was examined in elderly people. Arabinoxylan derivatives of Hydrolyzed Rice Bran (HRB) were prepared from water-soluble rice bran through partial processing using a carbohydrate complex. Using the water-soluble Rice Bran (RB) as a control, a cross over double-blind study was conducted on both substances over a 6-week administration period. Fifty elderly people aged from 70 to 95 years participated in the study and the comparative data from 36 participants were analyzed. There were no withdrawals from in the study due to the side effects of the experimental foods. Symptoms were observed and scored. The total symptom score for the RB treatment group was three times higher than that for the HRB treatment group. The average duration of symptoms was 2.6 days for RB whereas it was only 1.2 days for HRB. Furthermore, some immunomodulatory action was observed in laboratory tests. HRB was shown to be useful in reducing the physical stress associated with acute respiratory tract infection.

AB  - [Purpose]
Enzyme-treated rice bran (MGN3, BioBran) is a partially hydrolyzed hemicellulose obtained by the action of basidiomycete enzymes on the water-soluble hemicellulose of rice bran. It has been clarified so far that it has various physiological functions. However, sufficient research has not been conducted on what kind of effect it has on liver damage. In this study, to clarify the effect of MGN3 on liver damage, experiments with galactosamine (Ga1N) and acetaminophen (AAP) in rats were conducted. The effects of this substance on the development of liver damage were investigated.
[Methods]
SLC Wistar male rats (4 weeks old) were used in all experiments. After four days of preliminary breeding, the rats were grouped and reared. Experiment: A standard diet of AIN-76 was given ad libitum during the period. In Experiments 1-3, Ga1N was administered, and in Experiments 4 and 5, AAP was administered to induce experimental liver injury.
In Experiment 1, these rats were intraperitoneally injected with different concentrations of MGN3, and 1 hour later, 800 mg/kg of GalN was administered.
In Experiment 2, MGN3 was administered orally, and each of the high- and low-molecular-weight fractions of MGN3 was administered intraperitoneally.
In Experiment 3, MGN3 was heated, hydrolyzed, treated with ion-exchange resin, and administered intraperitoneally. One hour later, Ga1N was administered at a rate of 800 mg/kg.
In experiment 4, MGN3 was administered intraperitoneally or orally, and 1 hour later, AAP was administered at a rate of 700 mg/kg.
In Experiment 5, hydrolyzed MGN3 was administered intraperitoneally, and one hour later, AAP was administered at a rate of 500 mg/kg.
In all experiments, serum transaminase (GOT, GPT) activities were measured in rats dissected 24 hours after administration of Ga1N or AAP.
[Results and Discussion]
Experiment 1. Compared with the control group, all groups treated with MGN3 significantly suppressed the elevation of serum GOT and GPT activities due to GalN liver injury. Sufficient inhibitory effect on Ga1N liver injury was observed at an MGN3 dose of 20 mg/kg, and no change in the inhibitory effect on Ga1N liver injury was observed at higher concentrations.
Experiment 2. Serum GPT activity in Ga1N liver injury in all groups intraperitoneally administered with MGN3 or high-molecular-weight and low-molecular-weight fractions of MGN3 compared with the control group significantly suppressed the increase. A similar inhibitory effect was also observed by oral administration of MGN3.
Experiment 3. The increase in serum GOT activity caused by GalN liver injury was significantly suppressed in the hydrolyzed MGN3-administered group compared with the control group.
Experiment 4. Compared with the control group, the MGN3 intraperitoneal administration group and oral administration group significantly suppressed the elevation of serum GOT activity due to AAP liver injury.
Experiment 5. Based on the results of Experiment 3, the effect of hydrolyzed MGN3 on AAP was investigated. The increase in serum GOT activity was significantly suppressed in the hydrolyzed MGN3-administered group compared with the control group.
These findings suggest that MGN3 has an inhibitory effect on Ga1N liver injury and AAP liver injury. Also, it is presumed that the active ingredient is not hydrolyzed by HCI.

AB  - To find a new utilization of rice bran, nine higher fungi were examined for the production of exo-biopolymer with macrophage stimulating activity from rice bran. Among the exo-biopolymers produced from submerged cultures, Lentinus edodes showed the highest activity, followed by Grifola frondosa,
Schizophyllum commune, and Coriolus versicolor. L. edodes also had the most potent macrophage stimulating activity in a liquid culture rather than in a solid culture. In order to improve rice bran utilization and the yield of exo-biopolymer with macrophage stimulating activity, the treatment of Rapidase effectively increased the macrophage stimulating activity (about 30% increase), whereas the other enzymes (Econase, Viscozyme, Ultraflo, Celluclast, and Thermylase) treatments did not increase the macrophage stimulating activity. Exo-biopolymer with macrophage stimulating activity from L. edodes contained mainly neutral sugars (58.7%) with considerable amounts of uronic acid (32.2%) and a small amount of proteins (9.1%). Component sugars of exo-biopolymer consisted of mainly arabinose, galactose, glucose, mannose, and xylose (0.95:0.81:0.96:1.00: 0.39, respectively). When the exo-biopolymer was treated with NaIO4
, NaClO2 , and pronase, the NaClO2 and pronase digestion had little treatment effect, whereas NaIO4 oxidation significantly decreased the macrophage stimulating activity (47.6% reduction at 100 µg/ml). Therefore, the carbohydrate moiety in exo-biopolymer from L. edodes plays an important role in the expression of the macrophage stimulating activity.

AB  - MGN-3 is an arabinoxylan from rice bran that has been shown to be an excellent antioxidant and radioprotector. This study examined the protective effects of MGN-3 on radiation-induced intestinal injury. Mice were treated with MGN-3 prior to irradiation, then continued to receive MGN-3 for 4 weeks thereafter. MGN-3 increased the activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes Ⅰ, Ⅲ, Ⅳ and Ⅴ, the intercellular ATP content, the mitochondria-encoded gene expression and mitochondrial copy numbers in the jejunal and colonic mucosa. MGN-3 reduced the oxidative stress levels and inflammatory response indicators in the serum and jejunal and colonic mucosa. Antioxidant indicators such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase and total antioxidant capacity were significantly increased in the serum and jejunal and colonic mucosa in the MGN-3 group. Moreover, MGN-3 decreased the gene abundances and enzymatic activities of caspase-3, 8, 9 and 10 in the jejunal and colonic mucosa. The endotoxin, diamine peroxidase, d-lactate and zonulin levels were significantly reduced in the serum and jejunal and colonic mucosa in the MGN-3 group. MGN-3 also markedly upregulated the gene abundances of ZO-1, occludin, claudin-1 and mucin 2. MGN-3 effectively attenuated radiation-induced changes in the intestinal epithelial mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, inflammatory response, apoptosis, intestinal permeability and barrier function in mice. These findings add to our understanding of the potential mechanisms by which MGN-3 alleviates radioactive intestinal injury.

AB  - We investigated in this study the effect of modified arabinoxylan from rice bran (MGN-3) and its fractions on D-galactosamine (D-GalN)-induced IL-18 expression and hepatitis in rats. Male Wistar rats were pretreated with MGN-3 or fractions of the MGN-3 hydrolysate, or with saline 1 h before administering D-GalN (400 mg/kg B.W.). The serum transaminase activities, IL-18 mRNA expression level in the liver and IL-18 concentration in the serum were determined 24 h after injecting D-GalN. Both the oral and intraperitoneal administration of MGN-3 (20 mg/kg B.W.) alleviated D-GalN-induced hepatic injury under these experimental conditions. The low-molecular-weight fraction (LMW) of MGN-3 showed the strongest protective effect on D-GalN-induced liver injury, its main sugar component being glucose. Moreover, the D-GalN-induced IL-18 expression was significantly reduced by treating with MGN-3 and LMW. The results suggest that MGN-3 and LMW could provide significant protection against D-GalN liver injury, and that IL-18 might be involved in their protective influence.

AB  - d-Galactosamine (GalN) induces acute hepatitis in experimental animals; this hepatitis has been shown to be suppressed by oral or intraperitoneal administration of modified arabinoxylan from rice bran (MGN-3), and active low molecular fraction isolated from MGN-3 (LMW). We previously reported that this protective mechanism is mediated in part by downregulation of interleukin-18 (IL-18). The present study shows for the first time that nuclear factor-[kappa]B (NF-[kappa]B), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and CD14 are involved in the suppressive action of LMW on GalN-induced hepatitis. Wistar rats (aged 4 weeks, SLC) were intraperitoneally treated with either MGN-3 or LMW. Then, rats were given GalN at 400 mg/kg at 1 h after the initial treatment. The serum activity of transaminases (ALT and AST) was significantly higher after GalN treatment; these changes were attenuated by MGN-3 and LMW. Furthermore, LMW abrogated inhibitor of [kappa]B kinase (I[kappa]B) degradation induced by GalN, and this was associated with the inhibition of NF-[kappa]B activation. Moreover, phosphorylated stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) protein expression in the liver after GalN treatment was significantly higher, and LMW reduced this increase. We also found that GalN treatment induced TLR4 and CD14 mRNA expression, and LMW significantly inhibited CD14 mRNA expression. These results suggest that the suppressive effects of LMW on GalN-induced hepatitis are possibly related to inhibition of NF-[kappa]B, JNK phosphorylation and CD14 expression.

AB  - Angiogenesis is implicated in diverse pathological conditions such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, atherosclerosis, and retinal neovascularization. In the present study, we investigated the effects of modified rice bran hemicellulose (MRBH), a water-soluble hemicellulose preparation from rice bran treated with shiitake enzymes, on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis in vitro and its mechanism. We found that MRBH significantly inhibited VEGF-induced tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) co-cultured with human dermal fibroblasts. We also observed that MRBH dose-dependently suppressed the VEGF-induced proliferation and migration of HUVECs. Furthermore, examination of the anti-angiogenic mechanism indicated that MRBH reduced not only VEGF-induced activation of VEGF receptor 2 but also of the downstream signaling proteins Akt, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. These findings suggest that MRBH has in vitro anti-angiogenic effects that are partially mediated through the inhibition of VEGF signaling.
